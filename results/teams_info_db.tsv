879	Alberta	University of Alberta  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada  www.ualberta.ca	None	Collegiate	iGEM	North America	CANADA	Unspecified	iGEM 2012 Americas West	 Foundational Advance	Towards a microbial color wheel: spatial control of gene expression	As a young team composed of high schoolers and junior undergraduates, we selected a project aimed at giving ourselves a firm understanding in the fundamentals of genetic engineering and control. The end goal of our project was to create spatial color patterns using bacteria, such as a color wheel and a rainbow, that required control over several color outputs in response to spatial gradients of chemical inducers. Colour gradients were achieved using a high-copy plasmid that contained both an inducible colour gene and its corresponding repressor. Colour banding was achieved by a novel means of adjusting gene expression through plasmid copy number control that varied from 0 to ~1000 copies/cell as a function of inducer concentration. Note that the rapid loss of plasmid that occurs in the absence of inducer also constitutes a novel and extremely effective safety switch for genetically engineered organisms which might enter the environment.	dridgway	Douglas Ridgway	None	None	ellison	Mike Ellison	None	None	tepatric;rsshort;echidamb;rick24568509;p.west;tlemire;A.burke;abdullah.farooq;SarahHaeubl	Thomas Patrick;Robert Spencer Short;Easwaramurthyvasi Chidambaravasi;Nien-Tsu Tseng;Peter West;Torrin Lemire;Aidan Burke;Abdullah Farooq;Sarah Haeubl	None	None	BBa_K879000	BBa_K879999

Current technologies for detection of bacteria include DNA hybridization FRET signaling, electrical detection via immobilized antimicrobial peptides, and PCR amplification followed by gel visualization. Our method of bacterial detection fills a niche in biosensor technology. Our design implies lower costs, higher portability, and a more rapid signal output than most bacterial biosensors. Additionally, our interchangeable DNA probe confers modularity, allowing for a range of bacterial detection. Using a split beta-galactosidase complementation assay, we have designed three unique chimeric proteins that recognize and bind to specific pathogenic markers and create a functioning beta-galactosidase enzyme. This functioning enzyme unit then cleaves x-gal and produces a colorimetric output signal. Our research demonstrates success in initial stages of chimeric protein assembly.	kahaynes	Karmella Haynes	None	None	xiaowang;fluffy1	Xiao Wang;Vincent Pizziconi	None	None	ethan_ward;Rohit_Rajan;abhinavmarkus;Hyder;rmuller1;napatel;eqin;aispas;mhsands	Ethan Ward;Rohit Rajan;Abhinav Markus;Khateeb H.

Nowadays, 1.5 million tons/year from human activity which is used in the world is PET. PET is a thermoplastic polymer resin, not easily degraded naturally. Based on this background, the BAU-Indonesia team designs a plasmid which is contains of encoding cutinase degrading enzymes of producing PET. The early stage of this project was done by the preservation of plastic waste bacteria from landfills at Galuga. The bacteria were cultured in liquid media which is contained yeast extract powder and PET enrichment. The result of this preservation will be followed by the isolation of DNA and PCR with Cutinase F primer'ACGCGCCGGGCGTCACCGAGCA'3 and R 5'ACGCGTCGTGCCGTCAGGGCCA'3. Cutinase gen that were amplified will be inserted to plasmid pSB1C3. The recombinant plasmid which contained the cutinase gene will be introduced into E. coli. Finally it will be used as PET biodegradator product.	ach.farajallah	Achmad Farajallah	None	None	None	None	None	None	mfadhillah;Masrukhin;arinugroho;unis09;hendris09;aditrianr;muhamadabduh;restipratiwi;ayun;m.rizkifaisal	Mohammad Fadhillah;Masrukhin;Ari Nugroho;Uni Sutiah;Hendri Sutanto;Aditrian Rahim;muhamad abduh;Resti Pratiwi;kurrata ayun;M.

At present, engineering these properties is challenging due in large part to the inherent throughput limitation imposed by microscopy. We have developed a strategy that enables high-throughput library screening with microscopy by coupling a unique fluorescence signature with each genotype present in a library. These MiCodes (microscopy barcodes) are generated by targeting combinations of fluorophores to several organelles within yeast, and they eliminate the need to isolate and observe clonal populations separately. MiCodes can potentially scale to library sizes of 10^6 or more, and their analysis can be largely automated using existing image processing software. As a proof of principle, we applied MiCodes to the problem of finding unique pairs of protein-protein interaction parts.	jdueber	John Dueber	None	None	wideloache;tdj	Will DeLoache;Terry D.

Especially the use of synthetic estrogen in birth control pills results in increasing the concentrations of this disruptor in wastewater. Therefore, "iGEM Team Bielefeld" is developing a biological filter using immobilized laccases, enzymes able to radicalize and break down a broad range of aromatic substances. For the production of laccases from different bacteria, fungi and plants, two expression systems are used: "Escherichia coli" and the yeast "Pichia pastoris". Immobilization is carried out either by using cpc-silica beads or by fusing the enzymes to cellulose binding domains. The concept could be extended to other toxic pollutants in drinking and wastewater, as well as to industrial applications in paper and textile industries or even for bioremediation of contaminated soil.	joernk	Joern Kalinowski	None	None	DocDexter	Christian Rueckert	None	None	KevinJarosch;korates;fougee;isahu;rbraun;NadineL;JSchirmacher;gkleiner;Saskia;mo;Agatha;MalakF;derya;juvoss;swiebe	Kevin-Andre Jarosch;Hakan Geyik;Miriam Fougeras;Isabel Huber;Robert Braun;Nadine Legros;Julia Schirmacher;Gabriele Kleiner;Saskia Scheibler;Moritz Müller;Agatha Alexandra Walla;Malak Fawaz;Derya Kirasi;Julia Voß;Sebastian Wiebe	nluebke;TimoW	Nils Luebke;Timo Wolf	BBa_K863000	BBa_K863999

Fusion protein design has always been time- and design-intensive, to say the least. We are developing and characterizing a fusion construct containing a light sensitive domain, providing easy coupling and light activation of proteins of interest to investigators, thus developing a protein-level light-induced knockout.      Using the LOV (Light, Oxygen, Voltage) domain commonly found in plants, where it enables light-directed growth, we are establishing guidelines for coupling proteins of interest to the LOV domain, which allows control of protein activity through blue wavelength light. Designing our reversible knockout at the protein level allows quick response times (2.2 microseconds activation time, 85 seconds deactivation time).     A device of that kind could be of great importance as a tool for disinfection on a laboratory  scale or mutant selection via blue light. Further potential applications of our LOV fusion  system include bioreactor regulation or site-specific drug activation.	gue.mayer	Günter Mayer	None	None	mfamulok	Michael Famulok	None	None	NLudwig;MaxSch;KatharinaD;maklum;RebeccaH;psander;er_st;CMartens;KevBa;TaFu;JohnNguyen	Nicolas Ludwig;Max Schelski;Katharina Düker;Matthias Klumpp;Rebecca Halbach;Philipp N.

Our main goal is to engineer a single strain of bacteria able produce concentric patterns on the dishes. The challenge is to model a regulatory mechanism which mimics both cell differentiation and cell-to-cell communication observed in eukaryotes.  We chose to create four operons (a total of 21 assemblies): three to allow the communication and expression of a visible phenotype, the fourth  containing the genes needed for signal transduction. Each of the three first operons will respond to a specific quorum-sensing system (QSS) and trigger another QSS resulting in a chain reaction communicating a unique signal to all bacteria nearby.  We also developed our model in silico to run simulation and test parameters that influence pattern propagation on a petri dish.

We built a vast number of both simple and complex genetic circuits that were characterized using flow cytometry. These genetic circuits were built using an assembly technique called MoClo (developed by Weber et al., 2011), which involves a multi-way, one-pot digestion-ligation reaction, enabling faster and more efficient construction of genetic circuits. We converted a large subset of BioBrick™ Parts from the Registry (http://partsregistry.org/) into MoClo Parts using PCR and cloning strategies. We built and characterized various genetic circuits using MoClo Parts and compared them against their pre-existing BioBrick™ counterparts in order to compare the characterization results from the two assembly techniques. We also created a standardized data sheet to be included in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts for each Part we characterized to easily share our data with the synthetic biology community.	densmore	Douglas Densmore	None	None	THaddock	Traci H.

In contrast to this current paradigm, microbes have naturally evolved to survive as members of dynamic communities with distributed metabolism. This “divide and conquer” strategy allows the community to perform more complicated metabolic processing than would be possible in single microorganisms while being resilient to environmental changes. Despite very recent proof of concepts in developing model microbial consortia, or synthetic ecology, questions remain as to whether complex metabolic pathways can be engineered in context of microbial populations. The 2012 University of British Columbia iGEM team sets a precedent by engineering a tunable consortium with a distributed 4S desulfurization pathway for increased efficiency in the removal of organosulfurs in heavy oils and bitumen resources.	joannealisonfox	Joanne Fox	None	None	shallam	Steven Hallam	None	None	Ruichen;tingchiawong;minjup;joeho604;jacobtoth;grace.yi;mehuls;Cam;JohnHenry	Ruichen Xue;Ting-Chia Wong;Marianne (Minju) Park;Joe Ho;Jacob Toth;Grace Yi;Mehul Sharma;Cameron Strachan;John Henry Deppe	Ayjchan;mvanins;rsaer;jwround	Alina Chan;Michael VanInsberghe;Rafael saer;James W Round	BBa_K804000	BBa_K804999

Our system would allow the co-culture of several genetically engineered machines in tunable proportions. Hence the engineered organism would be a standard part! This defines a new level of modularity allowing the increase of the complexity of the system by moving to the community level.  We´ve come up with several plausible circuits designs and in silico predictions and decided to build a “crossfeeding” system in which each strain produces and secretes an aminoacid the other strains need to grow.  We characterized two auxotrophic yeast strains (for tryptophan and histidine) and designed novel biobricks that regulate the export of Trp and His rich peptides.   In the future this would allow for other modules to control the proportions of each strain, thus allowing dynamic and stimulus dependent changes in the abundances of each strain.	anadra	Alejandro Nadra	None	None	nachoquique	Ignacio E.

Last year, the BYU iGEM team genetically engineered E. coli to detect heat or ROS. This year we developed E. coli capable of simultaneously sensing lactate, heat and ROS, implemented a novel Cre-Lox system, and constructed a library of thermosensors.  Our project uses two circuits, each with a unique reporter.  The first circuit contains a RNA thermosensor driven by a ROS-inducible promoter, allowing expression of Cre recombinase when both heat and ROS are present.  Although heat is transient, Cre ensures continued expression of the first reporter gene.  The second circuit contains a periplasmic lactate sensor coupled to a second reporter.  Finally, we have evolved a library of thermosensors that work in a narrow physiological range.  Together, this two-circuit system may allow accurate and specific detection of early colon cancer cells.	jgrose	Julianne Grose	None	None	warnick	Sean Warnick	None	None	justinmeek;johnwshumway;reesj;ewilliamjones;MNSOD;buckleya;joeand;ksbollenbach;broark2;rossjack1;raf59;HilllaryEmery;Kimokun;JKitch;Yuro;jordantm;JosephThiriot	Justin Meek;John W.

FRED detects multiple compounds within one sample using an electrochemical output.  We created an open-source hardware and software platform to be used as a biosensor prototype.  For OSCAR, we designed and modeled a bioreactor to remove impurities (sulfur, nitrogen, and carboxylic acids) from tailings ponds. Known degradative microbial pathways were combined with unique engineering solutions in a bioreactor model. Furthermore, we developed ‘Ribo-kill-switches’ to prevent antibiotic resistance and disturbing natural flora.  Overall, this system aims to detect and convert toxins into clean hydrocarbons in an economical, safe, and self-contained process.	nygren	Anders Nygren	None	None	lmgieg;myarcell;rpgguardian	Lisa Gieg;Mayi Arcellana-Panlilio;David Lloyd	None	None	nickcassar;colinbrown;adam.hasham;kevinm.huie;achawdhry;james.thorogood93;pjwu;Lisa.O;cmwinter;himika9;jeffaddison89;zhibek;ali.honarmand;rmmayall;cqian;Emily_Hicks;Stephanie0101;anyakornilo;iaingeorge;peter11liu;nirabp;jmishra;mdmooney;Rai;jayw;Tsarina.VanWieren;yqi2012	Nicholas Cassar;Colin Brown;Adam Hasham;Kevin Huie;Asim Chawdhry;James Thorogood;Patrick Wu;Lisa Oberding;Chris Wintersinger;Himika Dastidar;Jeff Addison;Zhibek Salimbayeva;Ali Honarmand;Robert Mayall;Chenzhe Qian;Emily Hicks;Stephanie Willatt;Anya Kornilo;Iain George;Peter Liu;Nirab Pant;Jaya Mishra;Michael Mooney;Somshukla Chaudhuri;Yuanjian Wang;Tsarina VanWieren;Yue (Peter) Qi	Dmsilver;MaggieRY	Dylan Silver;Margaret Renaud-Young	BBa_K902000	BBa_K902999

This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.	jh295	Jim Haseloff	None	None	GMicklem	Gos Micklem	None	None	ap650;olijme;Jolyon.M;blipflip;CharlotteBG;scb67;emmyft;pdmallaband	Andreas Petrides;Oliver Meacock;Jolyon Martin;Thomas Whittaker;Charlotte Bransfield Garth;Stuart Bell;Fai Tsang;Paul Mallaband	None	None	BBa_K911000	BBa_K911999

However, quantitative information about the expression strength of a synthetic promoter has been difficult to obtain due to the lack of noninvasive and real-time approaches to measure the levels of both RNA and protein in cells. Here, we engineer a fluorogen-activated bio-sensor that can provide information on both transcription strength and translation efficiency. This biosensor is noninvasive, easily applied to a variety of promoters, and more efficient than existing technologies. To demonstrate the utility of our biosensor, we constructed and characterized several designed T7Lac hybrid promoters. Furthermore, we developed a mathematical model of our synthetic system to guide experiments and an open-source electronic kit that mimics experimental setup and well suited for education purposes. Our results could have a broad impact on the measurement and standardization of synthetic biological parts.	leocmt	Cheemeng Tan	None	None	natasa_mz	Natasa Miskov-Zivanov	None	None	enpederson;JSalazar88;PeterJWei;ychoo	Eric Pederson;Jesse Salazar;Peter Wei;Yang Choo	geyangcmu;dianam;Catalina;aaronmitchell	Ge Yang;Diana Marculescu;Catalina Achim;Aaron Mitchell	BBa_K921000	BBa_K921999

The first tool, MG-designer, is functionally divided into designer and viewer.   The viewer shows the information of genomes in both linear and circular form. So it is easier for users to understand the characteristic of genomes. By the designer, user can design minimal genomes by essential genes which are analogized by our team in this year. The minimal genome can be designed depending on characteristics of species by inserting the function of genes into particular locations.    With the second tool, brick-designer, user can design new bio-bricks.  It is also able to synthesize bricks by using the bricks registered in partsregistry. User can also utilize bricks he just designed. We tried to enhance software potability by enabling the bricks to save as Genbank and SBOL types. Brick also can be saved as picture file so that it is helpful in the Wiki implementation.	csrhee	Chung Sei Rhee	None	None	youngkim;dchung	Young-Chang Kim;Daehyun Chung	None	None	achievstar;WoodJs;hhj;jshsemo;byeonggonlee;Joddong89;kimjeaho;crireta;nalssniy;naoope;Jangwy8838;wannn;kim09064;galaxy16	Sehi LY'i;Ju Sang Ha;Hwi Ju Hong;Sehee Jeong;Byeong Gon Lee;Dong-Hyun Jo;JeaHo Kim;Yun-Gyun Ahn;Hyein Lee;Byeonggon Ji;WOO-YEONG, JANG;chang wan kim;YounJoo Kim;Sohee Park	None	None	BBa_K860000	BBa_K860999

This reaction is done almost instantly and it is used as a signal by distinct organisms like E.coli, C.albicans associated in the regulation of emergency signaling. Also, an association of the H+/HCO3- ratio and the signaling pathway of adenilate cyclase has been seen. The employment of these genes with reporter proteins can be used to indirectly calculate the concentration of environmental CO2.  The CO2 concentration depends on the partial pressure and the speed with it is assimilated by the liquid. The fastest it gets to the saturation point 5%, the higher is the CO2 concentration.	pablo	Pablo Padilla	None	None	msfunes	Soledad Funes	None	None	larsmx;fercea;gordeiros;ileana;cjdg;Jesús;LUIS DE JESUS;JOSE	Mario Sánchez Domínguez;Fernando Cea Olvera;Ricardo Munguía Díaz;Ileana de la Fuente Colmenares;Cristian Delgado;Jesús Pérez Juárez;LUIS DE JESUS MARTINEZ LOMELI;JOSE MARTINEZ LOMELI	None	None	BBa_K872000	BBa_K872999

Taking advantage of this, our project aims to build two genetic control systems based on R. sphaeroides photosynthesis cluster regulation. The first one is a light dependent system controlled by two proteins AppA/PpsR that works like an antirepresor/repressor mechanism, and the second one is an oxygen dependent system of two-component called PrrA/PrrB. This two devices were tested on R. palustris chassis, using a cassete in which a reporter (GFP) is regulated by external conditions that activate or repress its expresion. Once we have characterized the functionality of these networks, our perspective is to develop a Rhodofactory, it means to control the produccion of differents metabolites, such as biodiesel and butanol, using simple signals.	bioingenios	Agustino Martinez-Antonio	None	None	Rhodosuaste;pbzars;Nuria;JorgeM	Fernando Suaste Olmos;Paola Berenice Zárate Segura;Nuria Sanchez-Puig;Jorge Morales Montor	None	None	DnielDgz;ao.patricia;LoboLofi;Jhonatan;Maritere;Liss;KarenHega	Daniel Domínguez Gómez;Patricia Elizabeth Arias Orozco;Iván López Flores;Jhonatan Alejandro Hernandez-Valdes;Maritere Uriostegui-Arcos;Lissania Ximena Guerra-Calderas;Karen Hernandez Gallardo	UruguayanMayan;Fer;KarenNava	Daniel Federico Hernandez Gardiol;Fernando G.

There are over 200 possible PCBs, derivatives of biphenyl, which share the same biodegradation pathways in bacteria. Our team is using a genetic engineering approach to produce a small consortium of E. coli that should efficiently degrade biphenyl, and it is hoped that this same system can be adapted for the bioremediation of PCBs. Natural bioremediation by native bacterial communities is exceedingly slow due to the recalcitrant nature of PCBs and their hydrophobic properties which reduce the bioavailability to potential catabolizers. We are taking a three-pronged approach in an attempt to increase the efficiency of biphenyl bioremediation—attraction of biphenyl-degrading E. coli by other guiding bacteria, overexpression of the biphenyl catabolic enzymes, and production of a biosurfactant to increase the solubility of biphenyl. Together, this system should significantly increase the rate of biphenyl degradation.	tzuenrt	Tzuen-Rong Jeremy Tzeng	None	None	mcao	Min Cao	None	None	andreealuvv;ascanla@clemson.edu;rkane;KellyTM;mbickfo;wtsmith;rlouie;awhatle;wcrain	Andreea Nicolaica;Aaron Scanlan;Ryan Kane;Kelly Merchant;Matthew Bickford;William Smith;Rachel Louie;Ariel Whatley;Whitney Crain	abrown	Aaron Brown	BBa_K803000	BBa_K803999

Knowing full well the problems caused by Celiac disease, and the affinity many others have for reducing gluten in their diets, we decided to design and create a yeast strain capable of both fermenting quality beer, and breaking down gluten. Our search for an enzyme capable of breaking down gluten and neutralizing its toxicity led us to the enzyme mutated by the 2011 UW IGEM team. The modified Kumamolisin-As has a maximal activity at a pH of 4 and would work well in the pH range of 5.2-5.5 found in beer. For expression in yeast we had to account for codon bias, and optimized the sequence so it could more easily be moved from a prokaryotic system to a eukaryotic one.

This bacteria’s metabolism relies on its ability to oxidize iron; the iron can then be used to oxidize, and in turn solubilize, copper. By genetically altering the bacteria, we intend to install a light sensitive mechanism which will enable us to etch copper in a desired pattern, leaving a finished circuit board. Once a blank printed circuit board is placed in a thin layer of solid media, the bacteria will be applied onto the surface of the media and light will be focused on it in a desired pattern. The light sensitive mechanism in ferrooxidans would activate and self-destruct in the pathway of the light. In the end, the circuit board will be "etched" by the bacteria everywhere but the illuminated spots, leaving the desired pattern behind on the circuit board.

The cassette contains the luciferase enzyme and enzymes necessary for regeneration of its substrates.  The final goal is to make cyanobacteria (Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7002) glow because cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis and therefore do not need supplied nutrients. First, the experiment is carried out in E. coli and afterwards the plasmid is transferred to the cyanobacteria. Both of the systems will subsequently be thoroughly analyzed to determine important characteristics of the system including kinetics and efficiency of the expression levels.

To overcome this obstacle, the Cornell iGEM team has developed a new generation of biosensors capable of a direct current output which can be recorded easily with high precision. By upregulating the metal-reduction pathway of  Shewanella oneidensis in the presence of a target compound, these sensors can act as a continuos monitoring system.

To detect hazardous levels of sun radiation our system is based on UVR-8, a UV sensing protein from plants.   In its dark state, this protein forms a homodimer that dissociates upon UV radiation.    We fused UVR-8 with the DNA binding domain from TetR, which is unable to dimerize and to bind DNA in monomeric form. UV-exposure might force the TetR-UVR8 fusion dimer to split, release the DNA and enable transcription. Thus, TetR-UVR8 might act as a light-activated on-switch in bacteria.    We plan to use this novel switch to start the production of para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA), a common ingredient of sunscreen, and - dependent on the intensity and duration of exposure as determined by our detailed in silico model - a colored pigment as a visible warning signal.	sven	Sven Panke	None	None	joergs;langmo;MarkusJ;JohannesH	Joerg Stelling;Moritz Lang;Markus Jeschek;Johannes Haerle	None	None	Tim.Enke;Isi;stefang;lisase;huberdeb;dseifert;Gintas;skundert	Tim Enke;Isaak Mueller;Stefan Ganscha;Lisa Seyfarth;Deborah Huber;David Seifert;Gintautas Vainorius;Sandro Kundert	None	None	BBa_K909000	BBa_K909999

This leap towards multicellular biological engineering required new tools, so we first developed a new set of frog compatible vectors, biobricked tissue specific promoters and a new technique to assemble them in a single shot. To benefit from tissue compartmentalisation, we created a synthetic, orthogonal hormonal system using the plant molecule auxin. We also investigated E. coli/Xenopus interfacing, effectively creating a synthetic ecosystem. We modelled our system at the organism scale, using a multi-level and multi-technique approach. Finally, working with whole animals during iGEM brought a load of difficult ethical questions regarding animal biotechnologies and experimentation. This led us to wonder: Are we a chassis?

These properties stem from the relationships between the chemical nature of the sugars, their arrangement within the polymer and the arrangement of the polymer itself. Scientists rely on chemical modification of polysaccharides or expensive and time-consuming production via synthetic chemistry to understand these relationships.    This project, e-candi, asks if synthetic biology could generate designer polysaccharides.    We created biobricks for the biosynthesis of useful polysaccharides in Escherichia coli and asked whether we could synthesise a novel polymer sequence in E. coli by targeting endogenous polysaccharide biosynthesis.    We developed this work further through the generation of a GTase database with a user-friendly interface to aid polymer construction, and by investigating a GTase donor/acceptor characterization assay alongside mathematical modeling of our biosynthetic system in order to improve system understanding and performance.	tphoward	Thomas Howard	None	None	geolittlejohn;mtp206;penamiller;csambles	George Littlejohn;Mike Page;Rafael Pena-Miller;Christine Sambles	None	None	agb207;Stubby;On7h33dg3;mebexe;andycorbett;bond4000;Freddie;Lex;jamesml213;beccaphilp;Chris323	Alex Baldwin;Liam Stubbington;Ryan Edginton;Mary E.

Transactivator-Like Effectors (TALEs) are a brand-new technology that currently revolutionizes the way researchers manipulate DNA with exceptional site specificity. Originally derived from Xanthomonas spp., this type of protein comprizes an effector domain and a modular DNA binding domain that can be rationally designed to bind to virtually any target sequence of DNA. Over the past two years, universal endonucleases (TALENs) and transcription factors have been tested in various organisms ranging from bacteria to humans.  According to existing protocols, TALE assembly requires several weeks of work and substantial lab skills. In order to bring this technology within reach for iGEM students, we invented an extremely fast and easy TALE assembly strategy and developed a TALE platform with expression plasmids and new classes of TALEs.  With our so called GATE assembly kit, future iGEM students will be able to precisely manipulate genomic loci easier and faster than anyone else in the world.

The time switch we made counts the replication number of a single yeast cell, and triggers the activation of a certain gene (death gene, for example) when the replication number of the cell reaches the pre-set level. The work is an attempt to use the special quality of telomere and the end of chromosomes in the construction of synthetic biology device. Our system utilizes a whole new mechanism that is seldom used in cell counting device, and it enables us to delay the expression of a certain gene for generations. By control the life span of a certain cell, it sheds new light on the biosafety concerns and can be used for fields such as the protection of intellectual property rights.	xmding74	Xiaoming Ding	None	None	Ruoyu	Ruoyu Luo	None	None	jewel;Chocolatenw;DH_Chao;18dubu;Charmander;duoduo;Beta;WillWay;clover;eugenezhao;Christine;freechaser;caojie;otismage;Rangdonggua;Tarovey;Verve;lzmin;fengshui;Quta_qbbiotheo;Yilai;icyliu;firzen;NGNX;Arthurvon	Xiaoting Zhu;Wei Ning;Chao Zhang;Handong Ma;Hankun Li;Duo Xu;Taijie Jin;Wei Wei;Zhihao Guo;Xiang Zhao;Kangyun Dong;Yan-Cheng Chao;Jie Cao;Wentao Chen;Dan Chen;Zhongcheng Wang;Li Yu;Zengmin Li;zhengxi wu;Haotian Q.

In this optic, the Grenoble iGEM team has built an ultra-sensitive pathogen detector. It consists of three interconnected modules: 1- Detection, 2- Amplification/ Communication and 3- Output. The detection module consists of a recombinant membrane receptor that, once activated, actuates an amplification loop. The amplification system contains a genetic feed forward loop, which filters out false positive outputs. Once amplified and filtered, the signal is transmitted to neighboring bacteria via a diffusible molecule. In turn, the amplification loop is triggered which leads to the production of a measurable fluorescence output. The design of our network is easily adaptable to different input signals by using other receptor domains.	hans_geiselmann	Johannes Geiselmann	None	None	ropers;weidenhm;dejong	Delphine Ropers;marianne weidenhaupt;hidde de jong	None	None	clemenni;nadia_gre;adeline_millet;JulieH;Pierregrenoble;LINKS;Mathieu;greghansen;Eliseb	Nicolas CLÉMENT;Nadia Ben Dahmane;Adeline Millet;Julie Herrbach;Pierre Pautré;Jérôme LINKS;Mathieu Simonin;Grégory Hansen;Elise Berlinski	JeanBaptiste;BouGeo7314;PINHAL_Stephane;Valentin	Jean-Baptiste Lugagne;BOUCHAGE Geoffrey;PINHAL Stephane;Valentin Zulkower	BBa_K845000	BBa_K845999

This promoter, identified by microarray analysis, is significantly up-regulated in the presence of volatiles from spoiled meat. The activity of the promoter regulates the expression of the pigment reporter and will be visible to the naked eye. For safe usage of the system, spores of our engineered strain are placed into one half of a semi-permeable capsule, the second containing a calibrated amount of nutrients. Breaking the barrier between the two compartments allows germination and growth, thereby activating the spoiling meat sensor.	oscarkuipers	Oscar Kuipers	None	None	jwveening	Jan-Willem Veening	None	None	Elbrich;Tomvanlente;RenskevR;nisa.purwanto;avokajlop;jparrish;Alicja;YonathanD;emeraldo88;Arjan;Ismael;l Drenth	Elbrich Hendriks;Tom van Lente;Renske van Raaphorst;Annisa Astuti Purwanto;Wlada Poljakova;Jonathon Parrish;Alicja Daszczuk;Yonathan Dessalegne;Emeraldo Jo;Arjan Oldebesten;Isma	Martijn Herber	martijn_herber	BBa_K818000	BBa_K818999

The ability to make many orthogonal buffer amps is critical to scaling up digital information processing in vivo. For our project, we first provide two mathematical proofs: (1) the buffer amp is "equivalent" to a bistable circuit, in that the ability to create one implies the ability to create the other, and (2) inhibitors with first-order binding cannot allow bistability (without other elements). This means that methods such as TALORs and many sRNA strategies cannot build a buffer amp. Thus, we test a new method: sequence-specific formation of a DNA-DNA-RNA triple helix to block a promoter. By using a dimer for the RNA, we can achieve second-order binding, allowing us to build sequence-specific buffer amps.	drewell	Robert Drewell	None	None	None	None	None	None	jwentworth;szhang;mangorune;byeh;LWinkler;ablee	John Wentworth;Sherry Zhang;Benjamin Johnson;Beverly Yeh;Lauren Winkler;Bo Lee	None	None	BBa_K789000	BBa_K789999

PvdQ, an enzyme naturally produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is an acylase that functions to degrade long chain AHLs that bacteria like Pseudomonas putida or aeruginosa itself utilize for biofilm formation. Biofilms are population density-dependent structures formed by quorum sensing bacteria that produce and secrete auto-inducers, which signal selective gene transcription. These signaling molecules, namely the AHLs, are responsible for most bacterial pathogenicity including the opportunistic respiratory infections caused by P.aeuroginosa in immunocompromised patients.	jdhuang	Jiandong Huang	None	None	juliantanner;rmwatt	Julian A.

First module is to form bio-capsule by aggregation, using  cell-cell interactive protein “Ag43” located on the surface of E.  coli. Aggregate of E. coli enables collecting them by simple  filtration, so production of valuable materials will be more  efficient. Second module is to produce bio-plastic  (poly-3-hydroxybutyrate, P3HB). Development of cost-efficient method  to manufacture biodegradable plastic is one of the most important  issues for making sustainable future society.  We optimized culture conditions for more efficient production of  “Bio-capsule E. coli” and P3HB. This is the first successful  production of bio-plastic as an iGEM team. We will try to extend the  applicability of this system for producing other high-value  macromolecules in the capsule.

We exploited the use of halobacterial sensors, the sensory rhodopsins which are sensitive to a wide spectrum of readily available light source and build a series of sensing systems to control cellular movement and gene regulation. This system can be executed as a fundamental part for further applications, such as cell targeting and refining. Furthermore, to counter the safety issues caused by the leakage of bioengineered cells, this sensing method altogether with the CRISPR/Cas sytem can targart and achieve the cleavage of the transformed plasmid under the stimulation of natural light sources.

Bacteria have an efflux operon regulated by an arsenic sensitive inducible promoter.  It is possible through recombinant DNA technology to isolate this promoter and combine it to a reporter system and transform bacteria to create a biosensor for arsenic. Induction of the arsenic-sensitive promoter occurs by the binding of arsenite to an inhibitory protein, de-repressing transcription.  We have observed the arsenic responsive promoter from E. coli to have a consistent, low level of background induction.  We have tested the hypothesis that by increasing the quantity of the inhibitory protein in the cell, we can quantifiably raise the threshold of the response.  Our intention is to create a tunable biosensor to form the basis of a low-tech device that can reliably detect dangerous levels of arsenic in water for use in the developing world.	geotwaddle	George Twaddle	None	None	None	None	None	None	mikalski;ado;ahakaj;nan0t3k;rgeldner;Heather37;ahaines4;Jennparra;bigmomma;ChanceTheChase	christopher moseti;Alice Do;Andrea Hakaj;Floyd J.

Thanks to synthetic biology applications exploiting the yeast chassis, valuable compounds such as anti-malarial drugs and specialty chemicals can now be produced inexpensively. Using Golden Gate assembly designed for BioBrick compatibility, we have developed two tools to improve yeast expression of non-native pathways. First, we engineered an ethanol control system that reduces yeast's endogenous stress response and diverts more cellular resources towards product synthesis. Second, we constructed a light-induced system for instantaneous gain- and loss-of-function at the protein level. These tools will allow engineers to optimize heterologous pathways by monitoring toxic intermediates or regulating flux in a controllable, time-dependent manner.

Rice, which is the staple diet of India and many other countries around the world, is believed to engender many potential greenhouse gases or global warming gases per se like carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide, is released due to the inevitable use of nitrogen fertilizers which are added in the paddy fields. We are dealing with the conversion of nitrous oxide into nitrate form using synthetic biology tools to insert two genes into a bacterial cassette along with its detection systems. This nitrate, can be utilized by the plant itself, solving our purpose and adding a new dimension to this diversion and in turn being beneficial for the farmers reducing the compromise factor that would, otherwise, have been done.

852	Leicester	University of Leicester	None	Collegiate	iGEM	Europe	UNITED KINGDOM	Unspecified	iGEM 2012 Europe	 Food	A Synthetic Biology Solution To Polystyrene Degradation.	Objective - Naturally occurring organisms using polystyrene as their sole source of carbon have been recently identified, by analysing the occurrence of polystyrene breakdown products. However these metabolites accumulate very slowly, explaining why polystyrene is so persistent in the environment. Polystyrene can currently be recycled, but due to the low density of the majority of polystyrene products it is economically unfavourable, due to the high energy demands. If inexpensive biological degradation can be achieved this would assist recycling, but we also hope to use products of this reaction to make useful organic chemicals.     Aim - To construct BioBricks from the genes encoding enzymes involved in this pathway and manipulate their expression and properties to maximise the rate of polystyrene degradation.     Hypothesis - genes encoding the enzymes of the polystyrene breakdown pathway can be isolated and expressed in a host microorganism and the rate of the process increased by genetic manipulation.	badgerichard	Richard Badge	None	None	leicray	Raymond Dalgleish	None	None	AnthonyCox;Chris_r_morton;njdh1;lt114;Phiggs;willman92;ladybird136;Reema;iddu8	Anthony I.

Microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) has been utilized across the world to increase the productivity of these difficult resources. Using a synthetic biology approach, we have designed the CAB (CO2, acetic acid, biosurfactant) extraction method for a modified MEOR to extract carbonate oil deposits. CAB extraction will utilize natural carbon fixation machinery in the cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus to convert CO2 into sugars to fuel acetic acid and biosurfactant production in Escherichia coli. Acetic acid and biosurfactant applied to carbonate rock will facilitate and enhance extraction. The use of carbon fixation to feed downstream systems can be tailored for many applications requiring inexpensive methods for fueling biological systems, while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Biofilms are responsible for billions of dollars in production losses and treatment costs in the industry every year. Biofilm-related problems are major concerns in the food industry where it can cause food spoilage or poisoning, in health industry because of pathogens' persistence and dispersal, or in the oil and water industry where it causes corrosion. Assuming that the environment is already over-saturated with harmful chemicals such as biocides, whose long term health effects remains to be elucidated, there is a great need for innovating solutions to reduce detrimental biofilm effects.    To reduce the use of biocides, the INSA-Lyon iGEM team aims to engineer a bacterial "torpedo" capable to infiltrate and destroy biofilms formed on industrial equipments, pipes or reservoirs. Industrial surfaces will then be protected from further deleterious contamination by either a surfactant coating, or the establishment of a protective biofilm produced by the torpedo bacteria.	cdorelflamant	Corinne Dorel-Flamant	None	None	ylouis;Agnès;DesjardinV;obrette;poger	Yoann LOUIS;Agnès Rodrigue;Valérie Desjardin;Olivier BRETTE;Phil Oger	None	None	Clémence;mwolfovski;alex273;BastienDoix;carine;patricia.gifu;pishki;@nne;Suxiaohui;AudreyM;almiwe;MarionT;xavier69;beryl;Veldryn	Clémence GONTHIER;Marion Wolfovski;Alexandre Duprey;Bastien DOIX;carine gimbert;Patricia Gifu;Sandu Ioana;Anne Haziza;Viviane Chansavang;Audrey Masi;Alex Mizgier;Marion Traouan;xavier tholot;royer-bertrand beryl;Rémi Hocq	SPRINGER_Fanny;Chambi;Philou;briandet	Fanny SPRINGER;Gaël Chambonnier;Philippe Thomas;Romain Briandet	BBa_K802000	BBa_K802999

This project creates a light-dependent biological switch using the bacteriophytochromes from Deinococcus radiodurans and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. When coupled with heme oxygenase, these bacteriophytochromes are supplied with biliverdin, a pigment which allows for the self-assembly of a switch within the host system. In the presence of red light, the conformation of the bacteriophytochrome is modified. This reaction produces a visible colour change in the presence of red light, and can be used to control expression of a targeted gene when coupled with the appropriate response regulator. Exposure to far-red light will cause the bacteriophytochrome to revert to its original conformation, thus repressing the gene and reversing the colour change.	npacker	Nicki Packer	None	None	rwillows;lbrown	Robert Willows;Louise Brown	None	None	ryankenny;MStClair;Ellaina;andrewdiehm;ehoyer;41503163;Silas;JackB;LauraJ22;HSpedding;elleworgan;sarah.grixti;DanWinter;rob286;Mikken;Kimberlii;41484177	Ryan Kenny;Matthew StClair;Ellaina Andersson;Andrew Diehm;Erin Hoyer;Matthew Simon Smith;Silas Vick;Jack Brandy;Laura Jeffery;Harold Spedding;Ellen Worgan;Sarah Grixti;Daniel Winter;Robert McGraw;Miguel Sanjurjo;Kimberley Duncan;Gazelle Pashan	eddymoh;dr.biohacker;BlueDave;Red_Dave;Jo	Edward Moh;Yagiz Alp Aksoy;David Dubow;David Handler;Joanna Hare	BBa_K953000	BBa_K953999

This diversity is generated by random VDJ-recombination of a limited number of antibody subfragments. This inspired us to construct an automatic recombination system in E. coli that generates large numbers of novel proteins by combinatorial fusion of functional domains.    The site-specific DNA recombinase Gin of bacteriophage Mu depends on the presence of a DNA enhancer element for efficient recombination. This allowed us to construct a system, called “The Recombinator”, which automatically shuts down after successful recombination. We visualized the randomizing function of our genetically engineered slot machine by combining colors with cellular localization domains.    By scaling up the number of recombination modules and functional domains our system will be able to generate a multitude of new proteins.

Further, it is theoretically possible to create complex control circuits using combinations of invertible DNA sequences. We utilized the recombinase HbiF to augment an existing system in Escherichia coli that relied on the recombinase FimE. A burst of induced, low level expression of one recombinase will invert the promoter flanked by the recombinase binding sites, triggering a switch from strong expression of one set of proteins to another set. Induced expression of the second recombinase will revert the promoter to its original orientation, triggering the original set of protein expression. The inversion will be sustained across cell divisions with little leaky protein expression and negligible performance degradation after repeated inversions. This is a heritable, binary memory system and can be used as a component in more complex systems.	mcammer	Marc Ammerlaan	None	None	None	None	None	None	jatk;cbate;albanka;amyjb;ekirk;klminch;uniqenam;namunsri;chowe;Sspangl;MikeFerguson;shanwu;evolver;aventuri;knoxmich;kujasam;htwong;bwpark;hanliny;hanlinyang92	Joshua Atkinson;Christopher Bate;Alison Banka;Amy Bennett;Kirk Elliott;Kaitlyn Minchella;Josh Johnson;Namun Srivastava;Corey Howe;Scott Spangler;Mike Ferguson;Alena Wu;Joshua Abramson;Amy Venturino;Michael Knox;Sam Kujawski;Candy (Hiu-Tung) Wong;Benjamin Parker;Hanlin Yang;Hanlin Yang	jminty;wangke	Jeremy Minty;Ke Wang	BBa_K880000	BBa_K880999

Our project aims to improve the therapeutic property of S. typhimurium by modifying its amino acids-synthesizing genes and screen highly tumor-targeted strains. Then we standardize them to construct a general element used specifically in hypoxic tissues.

While rice can be fortified using vitamin powders, such approaches have had limited success because many vitamins are leeched away during the washing process prior to cooking. To address this problem, we have engineered proteins that will adhere nutrients to rice grains and prevent losses. These proteins contain a starch-binding domain that is fused to specific nutrient-binding domains. Because rice is composed mainly of starch, the starch-binding domain prevents nutrient leeching during washing. Upon cooking, the nutrient-binding domain denatures and releases the nutrients into the cooked rice. Supplementing rice with these fusion proteins will provide a novel, non-GMO approach to fortifying rice. Proteins with a starch-binding domain connected to a vitamin B12-binding domain, a thiamine-binding domain, a lysine-rich protein, and a RFP have been created.	cjhoward	Christie Howard	None	None	Shintani;leochong718	David Shintani;Chong Tang	None	None	jpavelka;jjiang;dordonez;rtruong;cclifford;jemlen;CSarcinella;mngo;verdi91	Jeremiah Pavelka;Simin Jiang;Dafne Ordonez;Ronald Truong;Chris Clifford;Justin Emlen;Cody Alexander Sarcinella;Michelle Ngo;Joseph Alexander	None	None	BBa_K931000	BBa_K931999

Surprisingly, this deficiency is typically not due to a lack of dietary iron, but rather due to low bio-availability, and thus poor absorption of iron. Phytic acid is a prevalent chelator of iron and other nutrients in food. Our mission is to build a system that breaks down phytic acid in the digestive system, releasing bound iron for the body to absorb. Our solution comprises two engineered components: a module that constitutively produces phytase to break down phytic acid and a pH-sensitive module that causes cells to lyse and release the accumulated phytase in the stomach. If successful, our strain would be a low-cost sustainable solution to preventing iron deficiency without the need for constant supplies of iron supplements.

Imagine a world in which all sectors of industry use synthetic biology to meet specific needs. The NRP-UEA team have developed novel biobricks, which provide a foundation for a system with this level of complexity. The project began with a simple idea with widespread applications: the detection of exogenous nitric oxide (NO). However it soon became clear the detection of highly reactive NO was challenging, and this was addressed in two main ways. A bacterial promoter, PyeaR, was fused to its mammalian counterpart, CArG. The functionality of this flexible dual promoter was determined in both mammalian and bacterial chassis. Yet it was determined that further specificity was still needed, leading to the comparator circuit, that subtracts the expression of one promoter from that of another, allowing for signal integration and quantitative computing.  This system thus allows for the detection of any chemical, providing the promoters have overlapping specificity.	rkelwick	Richard Kelwick	None	None	RBowater	Richard Bowater	None	None	khadijaouadi;joyehicks;YuenYeeLo;LukasHarnisch;Pascoe.J.Harvey;gcn10tdu;RussellGritton	Khadija Ouadi;Joy Edwards-Hicks;Rebecca Lo;Lukas Harnisch;Pascoe James Harvey;Rachel Dobson;Russell Gritton	ACongdon	Amy Congdon	BBa_K774000	BBa_K774999

Our approach for solving this problem has been to develop a genetic circuit that makes E.coli cells able to release toxic molecules only when in presence of cancer cells.  As cancer cells grow faster than healthy cells, they also consume more oxygen and release more lactate than a healthy cell would do, so to make the E.coli cells recognize cancer cells we have made a system where the input signals are high lactate concentration and low oxygen concentration. When these criteria are met, the E.coli cells will undergo lysis, and release the toxin colicin, which our cells are producing constitutively.  With our project, we want to show that one of the biggest challenges in medicine can be solved by synthetic biology.	eivnd	Eivind Almaas	None	None	rahmilale;eidsaa;Martin_HM	Rahmi Lale;Marius Eidsaa;Martin Hohmann-Marriott	None	None	Gunvor;oyas;Jarlemag;ninahole;eirinko;rolfheil	Gunvor Røkke;Ove Øyås;Jarle Pahr;Nina Lillebø Hole;Eirin Korvald;Rolf Heilemann Myhre	None	None	BBa_K822000	BBa_K822999

GLP-1, a human innate neuro-peptide for energy balance, is chosen to combat for obesity and metabolic syndrome. We engineer the non-pathogenic E. coli which senses fatty acids in intestines and secretes synthetic GLP-1. Appropriate signal peptides and penetratin are used to facilitate peptide secretion and intestinal uptake. Furthermore, we design a circuit with quorum sensing and double repressors, which aims to generate quick but sustainable responses and serves as an anti-noise filter. Plasmid stabilization modules including partition system and multimer resolution system are also incorporated to circumvent the undesirable loss or segregational instability of our artificial device. With this general concept of delivery of short peptide into human body, we can also target other human diseases with alternative circuit designs.	pcyang	Pan-Chyr Yang	None	None	Lino	Hsiao-Chun Huang	None	None	lbwang;bear20031;AndrewLi;cf221;popo;Angela;Ange;shihyi;Anjui;Edmund0610;Monkey781213;ray86047;JiangYingYu;delphiyoung;leep004;Jasmine;curtis999;charlotte_torng;oliverch77;Darlisereno	Liang Bo Wang;Tian-Shyang Shoung;Yen-Der Li;De-Hung Chen;Shan Chi Hsieh;Hsu Chia Jung;Chia-Jung Hsu;Shih-Yi Tseng;Anjui Wu;Cheng-Yeh Chen;Yu-hao liao;Jui-Tsen Yu;Jiang YingYu;Delphi Young;LEE, YI-TE;WANG, CHIEH-MEI;Kuo Chih-Chung;Wen Torng;Hung-Jen Chen;Hsin-Yu Lin	None	None	BBa_K817000	BBa_K817999

We planned to cultivate a special strain of genetically engineered cyanobacteria. With reductases metabolizing nitrogen, sulfur and carbon oxides, our organisms reduce three major pollutants in the modern day. Furthermore, we also focus on the removal of cadmium ions from soil. We tried to engineer E.coli to gain better capability of collecting cadmium ions. In fact, our engineered E.coli could stay inside of Dictyostelium discoideum, which allows us to build a biosafety system to make sure our GMOs won't become another threat to the environment.

However, issues of biosafety and ethics constrain the use of GEOs outside the lab. A primary concern is the Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) of synthetic genes to natural populations. Strategies developed to address this problem provide varying levels of containment, however, the substantial elimination of HGT remains difficult or perhaps impossible.    We have developed a new containment system to expand the range of environments where GEOs can be used safely. To do so, we rely on three levels of containment: physical containment with alginate capsules, semantic containment using an amber suppressor system, and an improved killswitch featuring delayed population-level suicide through complete genome degradation. We aim to raise the issue of biosafety by engaging the general public and scientific community through debate, and to advocate the discerning use of biosafety circuits in future iGEM projects.	ablindner	Ariel Lindner	None	None	adecrulle;ewintermute	Antoine Decrulle;Edwin Wintermute	None	None	iversondylan;GVillain;jrieders;jeancury;Denis.Samuylov;aprastowo;emordret;Claire09;zmarinkovic	Dylan Iverson;Guillaume VILLAIN;Julianne Rieders;Jean Cury;Denis Samuylov;Aishah Rumaysa Prastowo;Ernest Mordret;Claire Mayer;Zoran Marinkovic	Aleksandra;Babak;YangYifan	Aleksandra Nivina;Babak Nichabouri;Yang Yifan	BBa_K914000	BBa_K914999

Primarily, the sensor was designed by fusing blue-light-sensing protein domain from Neurospora with DNA binding domain of LexA from E.coli, following which protein structure inspection and kinetic simulation were conducted to rationally perform optimization. Amazingly, Luminesensor was proved to be as sensitive as to sense natural light and even bioluminescence. With this sensor, spatiotemporal control of cellular behavior, such as phototaxis, high-resolution 2-D and 3-D bio-printing using dim light and even luminescence of iPad were shown to be very easy. What’s more, we successfully implemented cell-cell signaling using light, which is the very first time in synthetic biology and of great importance for biotechnological use.	qiPku	Qi Ouyang	None	None	Spring_zhq;Robinbin;YangYi	Haoqian Zhang;Shuobing Chen;Yi Yang	None	None	lidayi;TheTinaChen;Qingting;jintanshadow;xingwm;luckybear;Shrine;zhangzidong;zhanghong;Jiawei;niasw;LiHanxi;fam0259;edenling;AlexYY;Xianjun;Zhengcai;Renmei	Li Dayi;Tina Chen;Zhen Qiu;LIU Jintan;XING, WENMIN;Tian Lu;Hongyu Xiong;Zhang Zidong;ZHANG Hong;Yan Jiawei;Sun Sibai;Li Hanxi;YU Zhou;Lu Yang;Ye Yu;Xianjun Chen;Zhengcai Ma;Renmei Liu	None	None	BBa_K819000	BBa_K819999

We stably transfect an antibody construct into CHO cells and mimic maturation by using the enzyme AID (activation-induced deaminase), which is known to induce somatic hypermutation. For selection, we are testing and deploying a versatile and continuous viral system as well as magnetic beads and cell sorting. Finally, a genetic switch enables the transition from surface expression to production of soluble antibodies.

On biofilm aggregation, expression of silica-binding peptides works to build silica matrices on the surface of cells. These matrices act as a mechanical filter for large particles and a barrier between the biofilm and fluid shear, decreasing dislodgment of organisms that could otherwise lead to fouling. We envision these improved biofilms being used in municipal water treatment to help recycle and filter home waste water streams, a concept we implemented in lab-scale membrane bioreactors.

Although much effort has gone into the production of ethanol, other biofuels, such as butanol, are superior. Butanol has a higher energy content, is less volatile, and is safer to use than ethanol. To develop strains of bacteria that produce high levels of 1-butanol we have introduced the genes coding for a biochemical pathway from Clostridium acetobutylicum into a mutant E. coli strain that produces a high level of NADH. The combination of these chemical pathways is predicted to increase the level of butanol production.

A high-energy diet, increases the amount of LPS-producing gut microbiota, and increased LPS levels has been observed in obese individuals. By inducing changes in the gut microbiota by prebiotics, like inulin, it is possible to decrease the plasma LPS level. This is associated with the stimulation of bifidobacterial growth. We have designed a novel approach to address this issue of plasma LPS, by probioticly induce changes in the gut flora by genetically modifying a bacteria to produce plant originated inulin. We cloned the two genes encoding sucrose:sucrose fructosyltransferase (SST) and fructose:fructose fructosyltransferase (FFT) from the Jerusalem artichoke into a E. coli, where it will produce inulin by using sucrose as an acceptor molecules. In the future this construct should be introduced by a probiotic lactobacillus, into the gut.	martinh	martin hanczyc	None	None	lclund;mbarnkob	Lars Christian Lund;Mike Barnkob	None	None	larsnorge;LisaG;Wronazky;SmokeySpartacus;andkj11;Idapp10;GabiOvergaard;Asbiorn;Reedorf;KKristianWürgler	Lars Norge Andreassen;Lisa Gundestrup;Andreas Wrona Jørgensen;Victor Vollesen;Andreas Kjær;Ida Appel;Gabi Overgaard;Asbjørn Müller;Malou Reedorf;Kristian Würgler Nielsen	AZA;jmollenhauer	Ann Zahle Andersen;Jan Mollenhauer	BBa_K899000	BBa_K899999

Hence, we come up with two innovative ways which have great advantages over the traditional one.  The first one, we try to take advantage of the bacteria's nature selection system. We construct a new plasmid which contains two types of genes, sweet and fatal for bacteria. Regularly, the sweet genes will be expressed, promoting the spread of bacteria transfer plasmid through conjugation. Once the amount of bacteria reaches a certain threshold, the dead gene will turn on, resulting in the death of the host bacteria.   The second method derive from the idea of dog-eat-dog, we attempt to cultivate a Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus strain, which live in cracking other bacteria. We consider to improve the sterilization efficiency to a certain bacteria.   All the two methods may avoid the probability of bacteria resistance at the same time.	whitecf	Yunfei Bai	None	None	fwang_seu;yppu_seu;fangxia_seu	Feng Wang;Yuepu Pu;Xia Fang	None	None	anyemelody;ziyou;Cassie;jiahaoruo;shawnna;poetdevin;Hpphins;Tiantang;xlan;LiWang;Moky;mokyII;MokyIII;fanzhou;Koala;EricMonty	yue hu;Yanjie Wang;Yaxian Zhou;Haoruo Jia;Xiao Han;Dadi Chioa;Ye ye;Dan Mo;ShengLan Zeng;Wang  Li;Gaowei Xu;Yu Ji;Xu Qian;he zhang;Rui Guan;Hongbo Xu	None	None	BBa_K873000	BBa_K873999

Distinct from linear DNA or RNA scaffolds in the traditional sense, the membrane protein system expands the dimension of reaction space, making possible the framework of numerous complex reactions on the two-dimensional plane, for example, switchable or circular reactions. In such a device, the membrane replaces DNA or RNA scaffolds as an extensive surface for proteins to anchor without limitation of expression amount. More importantly, by gathering the downstream enzymes through signal regulation, the reaction can be accelerated sharply. Besides, products can be transported much more efficiently from the inside to the outside of the cell in that the enzymes are tied to the membrane proteins. Hence the membrane is where the magic happens.	helin	Lin He	None	None	magang;ChobitParrot	Gang Ma;Wang You	None	None	Jucember;PorUnaCabeza;AleAlejandro;Yangjinglin;Jinzhenm;shaobozhang;zhiantinglan;linghanhu;ljcsinging;huanan1991;zhouyiwei;JenniferZhang;actin;albertwyq;songyuanhao;Stephen.W;Luke	Suo Yang;Xi Rui;Guo Huaqing;Jinglin Yang;Jin Zhenming;Shaobo Zhang;Yineng Yu;LINGHAN HU;Jingchang Li;Nan Hua;Zhou Yi Wei;Zhang Yuehan;YIN Ruonan;WU Yuqi;Yuanhao Song;Wu Jiajie;Shiyi Liu	xzt	Xie Zhitao	BBa_K771000	BBa_K771999

To approach the second question, the Hell Cell subgroup developed BioBricks that allow a cell to survive harsh extraterrestrial conditions. Such a toolset could create a space-ready synthetic organism to perform useful functions off-world. For example, the Biomining branch attempted to engineer bacteria to recycle used electronics by degenerating silica and extracting metal ions in situ. The Venus Life subproject grappled with the third key astrobiological question by exploring Carl Sagan’s theory that life could exist in Venusian clouds. To this end, Venus Life designed a cell-cycle reporter to test for growth in aerosol within an adapted Millikan apparatus. Through this triad of projects, Stanford-Brown iGEM aimed to illuminate synthetic biology’s value as a tool for astrobiology.

Truncating an enzyme previously shown to limit counterproductive metabolic regulation in terpenoid synthesis, together with a genetic construct design enabling the setup of a modular biofactory, potentially poses a foundation for applied interchangeable systems in synthetic biology. The need for reliable promoters for P. pastoris is addressed by characterizing four inducible promoters as standardized parts useful in controlling gene expression, with GFP as a reporter. The functionality of peroxisome-targeting signal PTS1 for use on the C-terminus of gene products is also analyzed. Difficulties in designing laboratory protocols and engineering genetic constructs are approached by developing a multi-purpose software tool to solve methodological obstacles, as well as facilitating implementation of a modular design on future projects.

It interacts with the anti-Shine-Dalgarno (ASD) sequence in the 16S rRNA in the ribosome to initiate protein translation. By mutate the basepair in the SD and ASD sequence, we produced an orthogonal translation system where the canonical ribosome cannot translate the orthogonal mRNA, and vice versa. We call this system O-Key. Using the O-Key, we are able to strictly control the synthesis of desired product and prevent potential contamination to the publics and environment. We can even build a completely new orthogonal phage that can only infect our engineered E. coli. With these successful examples, we demonstrated a bright and secure future that guarantees the safety of the human and environment with our O-Key.	yingjinyuan	Yingjin Yuan	None	None	None	None	None	None	Jiabin;austinamens;RenHengqian;mlplgs;AramaryShao;zhangjinlai;Pinglanwang;blueviola;YangLi;dreamsll;helengood;ni;Blue;toushirou_1220;happywwyf;lichao	Bin Jia;Qinfeng Wu;Hengqian Ren;Shu Gong;Yifeng Shao;Jinlai Zhang;Dongchang Qin;Xiaonan Cheng;Yang Li;Linlin Song;Jiaquan Liu;Lingli Ni;Yapeng Su;Andi Wangzhou;Yufei Wei;Chao Li	None	None	BBa_K821000	BBa_K821999

For this purpose we have chosen the E. coli strain Nissle 1917 which has been used for many years as a probiotic. We designed a robust gene guard system regulated by a novel and easy to control inducible cumate switch that activates the production of a human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 that can kill the bacteria and also avoid horizontal transfer.

Hopefully, the construction of these modules in the cell will be achieved, with the help of the site-specific recombination systems. Feedforward control theory is introduced into the module and mechanism on the behavior has long been under our analysis, all aiming at a better performance of the logic gate.

We align our ‘Designable Thermoswitches’ and gene of lysozyme together and put them into E.Coli to solve this problem.  The reconstructed E.Coli will switch on the procedure of self-lysate at the given temperature.  Thus, the fermentation product inside the engineered microorganism can be released.

The extensive use of fertilizers and the inability of sewage treatment plants to break down drug waste lead to increasingly high concentrations of so-called endocrine disruptors in rivers. As a result, male fish have been found to be less fertile and even develop female sex tissue, so called ovotesties. Since fish spawn is constantly exposed to river waters, fish development is easily disturbed, and while the ratio of female fish increases, population numbers decrease. For sensing we use a membrane-bound receptor of Danio rerio. Activation will lead to bioluminescence which can be read out by photometric measurement.

With annual production exceeding 100 million tons (2010), it creates an issue of PET waste. In Western countries less than 70% of PET production is recovered by recycling. Biological processes play no role so far, only expensive chemical processes are applicable yet. PET waste left to erosion in the environment creates nanoparticles which tend to accumulate toxic substances. This poses a growing environmental threat and a serious health risk. Thus, developing new methods for PET degradation has become an urgent issue. Team TUD designed a bacterial recycling system that uses PET waste as a resource for synthesis of new chemical compounds. The proposed solution pursues PET decomposition into its monomers, transportation into E. coli and leading via terephthalic acid (TPA) to a high-value end product. The latter’s specification is determined by the inserted enzymes to build new metabolic pathways.

This practice often requires placing large enzymatic pathways into one cell. Production of the desired product is usually affected by increased metabolic burden or negative feedback on the cell. In nature, however, many organisms work symbiotically to accomplish a task and/or provide mutual benefits to one another. For the first part of our project, we have studied two systems to create cellular codependence in E. coli - using either pairs of auxotrophs or toxin/antitoxins.

The GS gene was cloned on a methanococcal shuttle vector downstream of a strong promoter, and transformation of methanococci was confirmed via PCR.  GS catalyzes the conversion of geranyl diphosphate, an intermediate in biosynthesis of the isoprenoid lipids of these archaea, to geraniol, the major aromatic compound in roses and a potential biofuel. Small amounts of geraniol biosynthesis were detected in cultures of the transformants by GC/MS.  Methanogens are archaea that live in the guts of humans and animals and are responsible for the methane content of flatulence.  Thus, this project could convert personal polluters into an air freshener.  Because of the prevalence of flatulence among the aging population of the United States, the potential impact of this research is very high.	UGA	Yajun Yan	None	None	wbwhitman	William B.

Therefore, a modular RNA binding protein is an invaluable tool for gene regulation. The PUF domain of human PUM1 gene contains eight tandem repeats, each recognizing one of the four nucleotide bases. In theory, a PUF protein can be programmed to recognize any 8-nt ssRNA sequence. Here we demonstrate that PUF can be tethered with other functional domains for applications in E. Coli. Specifically, we show that a PUF/endonuclease fusion protein acts as RNA scissors, silencing gene expression through site specific mRNA cleavage. PUF was also tethered to split GFP to test its ability to co-localize proteins using a RNA scaffold. PUF biobricks offer a wide range of possible functions including gene expression modulation and scaffolding of metabolic pathways.	courtevans	Courtney Evans	None	None	rao12;kbhalerao;ysjin;joannema	Chris Rao;Kaustubh Bhalerao;Yong-Su Jin;Joanne Manaster	None	None	angelalovestheworld;achau;bchen26;schorna2;kirchho2;tankasa2;ukuzma2;iramos4;Adi25	Hsiao-Han Chen;Anthony Chau;Bob Chen;Cara Schornak;Asha Kirchhoff;Divya Tankasala;Uros Kuzmanovic;Isiah Ramos;Aditya Malik	KoriDunn;Ahmetbadur;Toddfreestone;bradevans	Kori Dunn;Ahmet Badur;Todd Freestone;Brad Evans	BBa_K865000	BBa_K865999

In this project, we are going to develop an exceptional natural tool that could be used to optimize bio-production pathways: the integron. Integrons are genetic platforms which contain (re)movable gene cassettes. These integrons are mostly known to carry resistances to antibiotics. They are flanked with recombination sites which allow gene shuffling inside the integron thanks to a specific enzyme: the integrase. With appropriate selective pressure, this shuffling should result in optimized production.  As a proof of concept, we are going to produce two antibiotics: Microcin C7 and Microcin B17. Two bacteria possessing the integron containing the antibiotics production gene cassettes, the integrase and a low resistance to the opposite antibiotic will be put in competition.   With the integrase, we could change the natural order of the genes in order to optimize production.

Current methods to clean black crust are either too destructive or non-effective. The aim of our project is to develop a system to more gently restore statues and monuments. To achieve this goal, we engineered E. coli to eat the black crust. More specifically, we introduced an aerobic sulfate reducing pathway and a hydrogen sulfide producing pathway into E. coli. In this way, the sulfate component of the black crust is transformed into a gas, thereby degrading the offending substance without degrading the original material of the statue. In addition to our black crust project, we developed a ratiometric fluorescence platform to test transcriptional terminators and subsequently used the platform to compare the efficiencies of T7 and E. coli transcriptional terminators with T7 and E. coli RNA polymerases.	olivierjousson	Olivier Jousson	None	None	cridelbianco;protocell	Cristina Del Bianco;Sheref Mansy	None	None	Tassa;daniele.rossetto;Giacomo;anna.d;jasonfweb;F.Guzz	Andrea Tassinari;Daniele Rossetto;Giacomo Giacomelli;Anna Depetris;Jason Fontana;Francesco Guzzonato	lmartini;robymarcia	Laura Martini;Roberta Lentini	BBa_K731000	BBa_K731999

Where attempts at physical removal and biodegradable plastics have failed to solve this pollution disaster, synthetic biology steps in. UCL’s project proposes the bioremediation of microplastic waste by two systems: degradation using a laccase enzyme or aggregation by controlled expression of curli. Ultimately we envisage the construction of habitable islands - turning waste into a resource. We used novel chassis: two marine bacteria, Oceanibulbus indoliflex  and Roseobacter denitrificans. In line with considering the viability of our project, we questioned the access ordinary citizens should have to these tools.

Serious infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria are a global healthcare problem. As the discovery of new antibiotics lags behind, we are developing new methods for targeting the resistance itself  - making resistant bacteria sensitive to old antibiotics once again. Working with real-world resistance genes from multi-resistant bacteria isolated at hospitals, we are developing anti-resistance systems to strike at three different levels: DNA, transcriptional and translational level.    At DNA level, we develop a method for increasing resistance plasmid loss rate.  At transcriptional level, we use super-repressors to repress transcription of resistance genes and native defense mechanisms.  At translational level, we develop a modular system for high-throughput screening of sRNAs to silence resistance genes.    We also provide tools useful for the whole synbio community, such as new standard backbones and methods for scarless gene deletion.

To help solve the problem, we design a gene circuit which can both detect and defend against the phages. We use the modified promoter pRM to sense the phage’s infection and initiate the defence. The lysis gene which can make bacteria lyse is installed in our circuit. When it works, the phage won’t be able to take advantage of its host to replicate any longer. To win more time for lysis to function well, we design antisense RNA to prevent the phage from turning into lytic life cycle. Thus, when the lysis protein kills the host, the phage is still at lysogenic life cycle or the newly assembled phages are still immature. By using the quorum sensing system, the bacteria around the host will prepare to defend in advance. Attribute to these parts, our bacteria survive.

In this approach, biological design guides both experiments and mathematical modeling, but is it possible to use experimental data to reversely engineer the mathematical model and guide backwards the biological design? This project answers the question. We use reverse engineering techniques to get mathematical models such as ordinary differential equations(ODEs), directly from the experimental data and build the feasible designs according to the models. In this sense, we not only fully connect biology, experiments and mathematics, but also get feasible designs that have certain behaviors.

These applications include artificial tendons and ligaments, biomedical sutures, athletic gear, parachute cords, air bags, and other yet discovered products which require a high tensile strength with amazing extendibility. Spiders however cannot be farmed because they are territorial and cannibalistic. Thus, an alternative to producing spider silk must be found. We aim to engineer spider silk genes into E. coli to produce this highly valuable product. Spider silk production in bacteria has been limited due to the highly repetitive nature of the spider silk amino acids in the protein. To overcome this obstacle we are using various synthetic biology techniques to boost spider silk protein production and increase cellular fitness. After successful production, spider silk protein is artificially spun into usable fibers and tested for physical properties.	cdmiller	Charles Miller	None	None	None	None	None	None	ahalling;Jamal2300;TomUsu;skiracer96;Fede;cwbarentine;ryanputman;canyoncatalyst;elizmartinez;swethac	Andrea Halling;Jamal Abdinor;Thomas Harris;Kathleen Miller;Federico Carlos Rodriguez;Charles Barentine;Ryan Putman;Brian Smith;Elizabeth Martinez;Swetha Chandrasekar	arahman;cankerz;Joshuatodd1;catramp	Asif Rahman;Cameron Copeland;Joshua Ellis;Cody Tramp	BBa_K844000	BBa_K844999

Quorum signaling allows bacteria to communicate with each other through the use of chemical signals. Bacteria use this form of signaling in nature to coordinate their behavior. Using three quorum signaling molecules we create unique connections between different populations of engineered bacteria and perform coordinated computing functions. We design and characterize standard and novel modules such as toggle switches, oscillators, signal propagators, and logic gates. As compared to engineering molecular circuitry in single populations, we aim to show that the synergistic approach to information processing leads to improved, scalable, and tunable operation.

It is a novel proposal of synthetic ecology, based on the use of an efficient photosynthesizer (the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus) modified to become an exporter of sucrose and diel switch of the activity of Aliivibrio fischeri, a marine bacterium widely known for its bioluminescent properties in response to quorum sensing signals. Our modified cyanobacteria feed the population of A. fischeri through a transporter protein and produce AHL to induce bioluminescence in response to the activity of a photosensitive operator, which would activate only at night. We also have tried to transform different microalgae with bioluminescence genes to test their effectiveness. We look forward to develop an efficient and autosufficient environmentally friendly biolamp, with potential application to cover the illumination needs of many infrastructure sectors.	jfurchue	Javier Urchueguía	None	None	None	None	None	None	crimaca;aurfor;Antropoteuthis;Juan_Luis;daie07;Roocfer;irewija;Jesterface;Gonzalo;essanchi27;ruthvlc;konestich	CRISTINA MAS CANO;Arantxa Urchueguía;Alejandro Damián Serrano;Juan Luis Reig Valiente;Elia Pérez León;Rocío Ochoa Fernández;Irene Guijarro García;Ismael Mullor Ruiz;Gonzalo de Oyanguren Aparicio;Estefanía Sánchez Chicharro;Ruth Sanz Tamarit;Miguel Angel Gaspar Celda	gamermann;divadfu;masiupau;Arnau	Daniel Gamermann;David Fuente Herraiz;Maria Siurana;Arnau Montagud	BBa_K754000	BBa_K754999

We do. We have designed, constructed and characterized an inter-specific translator based on light pulses that allows to literally dialogue with microorganisms. We have built seven biobricks with fluorescent proteins under the control of environmentally-sensitive promoters. The process is as follows: human voice messages are electronically- and then light-encoded in excitation wavelengths, and microbial proteins’ emission wavelengths are electronically- and voice-encoded back. We have used this system to find out the fermentative status of budding yeast and to dialogue with E. coli allowing it to answer questions such as “are you hungry?” The three pillars of our project (human practices, modeling and wetlab) yielded continuous feedback with each other, illustrating an integrated interdisciplinary approach.

The bacteria used for the degradation of the waste was Bacillus subtilis genetically modified to include the part BBa_J45014 which codes for banana smell. This was included to ensure a more pleasant smell during the working of the fuel cell and also provides an indicator for the battery life of the cell. Pseudomonas aeuroginosa was also used as a helper bacterium in the generation of electricity. The preliminary results indicated a production of banana odour by the bacteria. However, preliminary tests with the first MFC design did not result in a measurable electricity generation. Further tests with a different salt bridge composition and fuel cell design are underway to arrive at an efficient cell that produces a sizable electricity output that could be used to power small electrical devices.	reena.b	B.

Our team implemented broadly applicable methods to optimize biological systems through directed evolution, light-regulated gene expression, and computer aided protein design. We characterized light-inducible protein expression systems for multichromatic tuning of biological pathways. To provide an inexpensive method for tuning gene expression with light, we developed a tablet application that is freely available. We also used computer-aided design to develop proteins that more effectively bind isotypes of the flu protein Hemagglutinin. Finally, we implemented a continuous culture device (turbidostat) in order to apply directed evolution to the metabolism of ethylene glycol in E. coli. We have termed the research conducted this year “Apptogenetics” as all projects utilize purpose-built computational applications for biological research.

PCC 6803 and Escherichia coli	Saffron is highly valued as a spice that adds unmatched flavor, aroma, and color to food. A project was designed to synthesize three chemicals which compose a significant portion of the aroma and coloration of the spice saffron: safranal, picrocrocin, and crocin. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was chosen as the chassis because of its photosynthetic nature and native production of the substrate, zeaxanthin. It was proposed that the cloning of two genes ZCD and UGTCs2, would be sufficient to make the compounds in this organism.  These two were cloned into E. coli in conjunction with the genes necessary to produce zeaxanthin.  ZCD was successfully cloned into E. coli with the aid of a fusion protein to minimize the presence of inclusion bodies.  This result was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by trypsin digestion and LC-MS/MS. With this groundwork laid, future work can produce a biosynthetic alternative to saffron.	jjez	Joseph Jez	None	None	None	None	None	None	BrianBasco;andrew.ng;lucasharr;caf392	Brian Basco;Andrew Ng;Lucas B.

To make this possible, intron sequences are used to flank non-protein parts embedded in coding sequences. An intron sequence with an embedded recombination site is capable of in vivo insertion of a compatible protein fusion part. As an example, a GFP-fusion was created with an intervening lox site that is removed from the final protein using the intron to form a fully functional GFP protein.	ingalls	Brian Ingalls	None	None	None	None	None	None	honpeter;kkarpins;abiskup;mthiagar;lyianndga;hbandukw;rachowdh;aaronb;dlieuson;a3dhawan;AnjaliA.;paulreginato;d2chhina;ebibra;Lilycloud;siburru;ukishor;ecpgieicg;j22truon;v5vuong	Joon Hyuk Hong;Katarzyna Karpinska-Leydier;Angela Biskupovic;Madhuran Thiagarajah;Linda Yang;Hina Bandukwala;Rummy A.

According to the latest Cancer Stem Cell Theory, not all the cancer cells have the same ability to generate new tumors. Tumor growth is mostly driven by a small proportion of cells, the CSCs. In addition to having high proliferation rates, CSCs are more resistant to chemotherapy. This indicates that while regular cancer cells are killed, CSCs may remain unaffected and give rise to new tumors once the treatment stops.     CSCs produce increased levels of a particular enzyme, Aldehyde Dehydrogenase. We have identified its 3 most frequent isoforms (ALDH1A1, ALDH1A3 and ALDH3A1)in aggressive types of cancer, and used their gene promoters to build our CSC-targeting constructs: the iSTEM -Intelligent Synthetic Tumor Eliminating Machine.	mbmoc	Mark Clements	None	None	HowardBoland	Howard Boland	None	None	moyin;Rad;Sara_Jane;s.berciano;karinford;Louise123;priyashankar;neil;Hima;Aaskin;anasokolovic;tkounenis	Moyin Odugbemi;Radoslaw Kwasniak;Caroline Champion;Silvia Berciano Benitez;Karin Ford;Louise Usher;ShanmugaPriya Subramaniam;shreenil odedra;Hima puthussery;Annalie Askin;Ana Sokolovic;Thanos Kounenis	None	None	BBa_K940000	BBa_K940999

An incomplete knowledge base of developmental mechanisms impedes stem cell research and innovation. The iDifferentiate system is a genetic engineering platform that may be used to elucidate differentiation pathways of any cell type for which there is a known lineage-specific cis-regulatory element. To demonstrate this system we developed the SAVE Assay, which uses visual cues to indicate the overall quantity and relative percentage of atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes amongst differentiated stem cells. The assay uses a dual plasmid system that selects for successfully transformed stem cells via neomycin and puromycin resistance along with fluorescent reporter genes regulated by atrial and ventricular promoters. Altering the basic protocol by using different reagents and induction factors will allow scientists to quickly and accurately determine differentiation pathways of two or more related cell types.

We put GFP equipped with degradation tags in downstream to illuminate our numbers and change them quickly as well. Considering our engineering background, we accordingly employ cell immobilization to build our device. Engineering bacteria have been embedded in intra-hallow calcium alginate microcapsules and in PDMDAAC-NaCS microcapsules, respectively. In addition, 3D CAD design is performed for a perfect device.  Our genetic circuits vary in length and RBS strength, leading to different durations of time delay for GFP expression. This inspired us to extend our work last year. By altering the strength of RBS at five grades, another five circuits have been built. After the induction by arabinose, the duration of response time for GFP expression increases as the strength of RBS declines, bringing about a time-course display.

The scaffold allows efficient channeling of substrates to products over several enzymatic steps by limiting the diffusion of intermediates thus providing a bright future for solving the problem.

Using cell cytometry (FACS) and fluorimetry, we demonstrated in yeast the successful expression and translational regulation of a fusion of mRNA binding protein and fluorescent protein. These results, along with published parameter values, were used to predict via deterministic and stochastic models that the probability of successful bistability for our switch was 0.96%, but this could be improved theoretically to a maximum of 51.27% by limiting the range of variation of the most sensitive parameters.  The models also predicted that co-operative binding of the mRNA binding protein to its mRNA stem loop was essential for generating switch-like behaviour.  These results suggest that a translationally regulated genetic toggle switch is a viable and novel engineering concept applicable to medicinal, environmental and technological problems.	i.stansfield	Ian Stansfield	None	None	ebenhoeh;y.saka;DuncanShaw;romano;marco_thiel	Oliver Ebenhoeh;Yasushi Saka;Duncan Shaw;M.

Democratizing Synthetic Biology will demand fundamental advances to make DNA construction easier and cheaper, thereby enabling broader access to biotechnology by the public. Our team has tackled this challenge with the design of an inexpensive self-contained kit called GENOMIKON, currently targeted for the high school and DIY communities but with clear potential for professional use. The kit contains prefabricated parts that are sequentially assembled on a solid support using cycle times of 5 min./part with a coupling efficiency of ~95%. The parts exist with sufficient diversity and quantity for hundreds of unique experiments. The kit is accompanied by an online resource that serves as lab manual, notebook, information management system and social network for the exchange of ideas.

In addition, we have developed inexpensive and easily assembled lab equipment such as a gel electrophoresis apparatus and a PCR thermal cycler.

These easy to culture and robust organisms are also a desirable eukaryotic chassis for synthetic biology, but there are few tools for delivering biomolecules into these organisms. So, we engineered E. coli to deliver proteins and/or DNA payloads into these bacteria-devouring eukaryotes. Once ingested, our E. coli are programmed to self-lyse and porate the phagosome, releasing their payloads into the cytosol. This delivery mechanism has the potential to deliver payload to any phagocytic organism with a cholesterol-based membrane. As part of our parallel software effort to rework the Clotho plugin environment and API, we made automatic biosafety handling an intrinsic feature of the core. Together, these tools provide a foundation for metazoan synthetic biology and a framework for improving safety in our field.	JCAnderson	Chris Anderson	None	None	tdj	Terry D.

By using directed evolution, we aim to modulate the receptor binding domain to enable the interaction with similar phenolic substances like capsaicin. Brought into E. coli, this modulated system will induce light effects of different intensities - depending on the concentration of capsaicin respectively the spiciness of the sample. The capsaicin detection is a proof of principle concept.

Biofilms commonly cause complications in both industrial and medical settings and represent a significant source of morbidity and mortality. A synthetic biology approach to tackling biofilms has only recently been applied to Escherichia coli biofilms.

Production of these intermediates is currently triggered by inefficient methods, such as chemical inputs (tetracycline, estrogen-analogs, arabinose, etc) or drastic changes to the cellular environment (pH, oxygen levels, temperature, etc). On an industrial scale, this chemical induction requires large quantities of reagents and extensive purification, while environmental induction requires conditions that can adversely affect cell vitality and yield. To this end, we have designed an E. coli genetic circuit that can pass through four stable states of protein production triggered solely by ON/OFF patterns of light. To efficiently test the components of our circuit, we have also created a system for the transient delivery of transcription factors through the cell and nuclear membranes. With this production method, we can link multiple synthesis steps to a single, clean and rapidly scalable input.	areich	Adrian Reich	None	None	rhet;szswartz;djd	Gary Wessel;Zak Swartz;Diana J.

A major stumbling block however, is often an inability to express functional protein.  This situation is difficult to manage and troubleshoot as it is often unclear why expression is failing. We have designed a system that can accurately and visually report whether a gene is being transcribed and/or translated. The system also differentiates whether expression is failing due to misfolding in the periplasm or cytoplasm.  In the case of misfolding, our system can also fine tune expression levels of a given protein to optimize production, increasing the likelihood of obtaining functional protein.  To further understand protein misfolding we have built an equation-based, multivariant model of inclusion body formation.  Finally, we used a series of podcasts to explore the social implications of our project in the context of the growing synthetic biology industry.	clogan	Cairine Logan	None	None	None	None	None	None	jdchoo;cktang;h.dastidar;raidakhwaja;dvyas;Emily_Hicks;pjwu;ajgrigg	Jeremy Choo;Christopher Tang;Himika Ghosh Dastidar;Raida Khwaja;Dev Vyas;Emily Hicks;Patrick Wu;Alexander Grigg	pauladamiak;DCurran	Paul Adamiak;Dave Curran	BBa_K339000	BBa_K339999

Taking genes from fireflies and Vibrio fischeri, the Cambridge team have constructed BioBricks which allow light output at a wide range of wavelengths.  Firefly luciferase is already used as a reporter, but requires continual addition of the expensive substrate luciferin.  We have created codon-optimised operons combining luciferase with a luciferin regenerating enzyme (LRE).  This allows recycling of luciferin for sustained light output. In addition, we have submitted the first lux operon to the registry, taking genes from bacteria which form symbiotic relationships with squid.  This is the first BioBrick to emit light without addition of substrate and can be used as a reporter with any promoter. These two approaches will allow cheaper assays with brighter signals.

This year, iGEM CHIBA is constructing genetic double-click system whose output is released only when the input (inducing agent) is given twice within a limited time. To discriminate double-click from two separated single-clicks, the 1st input is to be memorized temporarily. If the 2nd input is added before the memory gets lost, output will be produced. If the 2nd input is not added within the given time, the system will be reset to the original state. This mechanism could work as a sort of safety device; by requiring the 2nd 'confirmation' input, one can drastically reduce, or even eliminate, the frequency of false-inputs.

For the application of this project and others, we are also developing a high throughput gene expression screen for synthetic gene libraries and codon variants, allowing for the possibility of tunable gene expression levels.	jingdongtian	Jingdong Tian	None	None	None	None	None	None	zhup;nicholastang;SFenu;kchien;aang	Peter Zhu;Nicholas Tang;Stefano Fenu;Kevin Chien;Andrew Ang	MaggieQ	Jiayuan Quan	BBa_K429000	BBa_K429999

Synthetic biology and iGEM have long?attempted to refine this process of 'bridge-building'. The 2010 University of Edinburgh team has applied this idea comprehensively throughout their project. The BRIDGE protocol (BioBrick Recombineering In Direct Genome Editing) is a protocol for markerless insertion of BioBricks onto the bacterial chromosome, which will bridge ideas and reality in synthetic biology. Bacterial BRIDGEs aim to foster non-chemical means of communication between bacteria by pairing light-producing and light-sensing BioBricks; future teams may make use of them in a variety of novel applications. Finally, human BRIDGEs examine synthetic biology as ways of thinking and the permeation of human aspects, bridging the so-called 'divides' between disciplines and individuals.

The EPFL iGEM project aims to stop malaria propagation by acting on the vector: the mosquito. We are engineering Asaia, a bacterium that naturally lives in the mosquito's gut, to express an immunotoxin that can prevent the malaria agent Plasmodium falciparum from infecting the mosquito, thereby eliminating the transmission of this parasite to humans. Asaia is an organism that is easy to grow and genetically manipulate. We are establishing Asaia as a new chassis so that future iGEM teams can quickly and efficiently engineer new and more potent Asaia strains.

Although the assembly was successful, the resulting detector is leaky with measurable RFP even in conditions with no iron present. In our lab environment, we found that it was necessary to work with relatively high concentrations of bacteria and DNA. We developed simplified procedures for transformations, digests, and ligations, but we continue to face problems with DNA visualization and measuring the pigments from the bacteria.

In the AOX pathway, electrons are transferred from ubiquonone to AOX, and then directly used to reduce oxygen. The drop in the electric potential energy of the electrons transferred from AOX to oxygen is dissipated as heat. Our project has focused on 1) cloning the AOX gene from a thermogenic plant (Sacred Lotus) into E. coli to induce a thermogenic response to a cold-shock, and 2) calculating a theoretical rate of heat production per bacterial colony to select for an appropriate calorimetric technique. Further, numerical methods in MATLAB will be employed to model the steady-state temperature profile of the synthetic bacterial colony, and to potentially corroborate later experimental findings. Engineering a controlled thermogenic response in bacteria could lead to improved bacterial functioning in cold shock environments.

Hydrophobicity keeps a surface clean and dry preventing micro-organisms from attaching to a surface. Most chemical  coatings used presently are costly or harmful to the environment. Our idea is to engineer Bacillus subtilis which when applied to a surface, automatically forms a hydrophobic biofilm coating. Succesful biofilm formation will serve as a trigger for the expression of hydrophobic proteins called Chaplins. The result of this process will be a rigid biofilm with embedded hydrophobic proteins, leaving a coated surface which is extremely hydrophobic. Producing a self-assembling hydrophobic biofilm is cheap, there is no high-tech treatment involved and there are no hazardous chemicals necessary to attain a hydrophobic coating. Applications of this hydrophobic biofilm range from anti-fouling coatings on ships to anti-corrosion coatings used to protect sensory equipment.	oscarkuipers	Oscar Kuipers	None	None	jwveening;dclaessen	Jan-Willem Veening;Dennis Claessen	None	None	Ptr;Ekkers;joelkuiper;Geeske;djokehendriks;MJvdN;LauravdS;AJ;neima;aslomp;jorrithillebrand;ramon	Peter Roemers;David Ekkers;Joël Kuiper;Geeske van Heel;Djoke Hendriks;Maarten van den Nieuwenhof;Laura van der Straat;Arend Jan Suk;Hacer Ezgi KARAKA;Arend Slomp;Jorrit Hillebrand;ramon sieber	Wilfred	Wilfred Poppinga	BBa_K305000	BBa_K305999

We engineered a toolkit for standardized measurements of interactions between artificial miRNAs and their binding sites. From this data we were able to compute an in silico model integrating binding site properties and knockdown percentages. Thus, the expression level of any gene of choice could be arbitrarily adjusted by employing the corresponding binding site design. To produce tissue specific miRNA gene shuttles, we developed an evolution-based method for synthesis of new adeno associated viruses. This enabled us to overcome the natural limitations of virus selectivity. In the future, miBricks could be applied for treatment of diseases like Diabetes and Hemophilia, opening the doors to new Synthetic Biology based medical approaches.	jenskeienburg	Jens Keienburg	None	None	mayermat	Matthias Mayer	None	None	FriederikeKöppe;Dima;Ola;aasthamathur04;Jude;Rebecca;ThomasU;Lorenz;dniopek;AlejandroHD;Laura_Nadine;Stefan_N;kleinsorg;janulrich;philippbayer;leaflocke;rudolf;Elenina;MarcusPodewski;Xiaoting;mbechtle	Friederike Köppe;Dmytro Mayilo;Aleksandra Anna Kolodziejczyk;Aastha Mathur;Jude Al-Sabah;Rebecca Berrens;Thomas Uhlig;Lorenz Kurt Adlung;Dominik Niopek;Alejandro Macias-Torre;Laura-Nadine Schuhmacher;Stefan Neumann;Stefan Kleinsorg;Jan-Ulrich Schad;Philipp Bayer;Lea Flocke;Rudolf Pisa;Elena Cristiano;Marcus Podewski;Xiaoting Wu;Marina Bechtle	reils;Docdirk;Kath;cchoe;cliesche;PGA	Roland Eils;Dirk Grimm;Kathleen Boerner;Charley Choe;Clarissa Liesche;Paula Gonzalez	BBa_K337000	BBa_K337999

To accomplish this, we are constructing chimeric quorum sensing receptors that can localize on Lactobacillus membrane and detect autoinducing peptides (AIPs) released by S. aureus. The ligand binding to the chimeric receptor will trigger downstream plnABCD pathway and initiate the synthesis and secretion of RNAIII inhibiting peptide (RIP), a heptapeptide with proven effectiveness in attenuating S. aureus virulence. The possibility of achieving this lies in the structural homology of the catalytic domain of the quorum sensing receptors in Lactobacillus and S. aureus. Both receptors belong to the HPK10 subfamily of a two-component histidine kinase family. Attenuation of S. aureus virulence by quorum-sensing inhibitors should not yield a strong selective pressure for development of resistance, and would therefore be an attractive concept for preventive medicine.	kinglchow	King L.

We aim to control their production in E.  coli thanks to a new part: a strong promoter sensitive to the shaking speed and the temperature of the water bath. By controlling this production, our team focuses on two final purposes : (1) the granule as a storage system for overproduced lipids with medical applications, such as DHA or EPA and (2) the granule as self-cleaving micro-beads in order to purify a recombinant protein of interest. In bacteria, three separate monofunctional enzymes are required for PHA synthesis. In order to improve this pathway, we intend to model a single multifunctional enzyme based on the study of natural evolution of fatty acid synthesis in animals.	phlejeune	Philippe Lejeune	None	None	NAT;Arnaud;aX	Nathalie Isorce;Arnaud Rondelet;axel cournac	None	None	banban;Florent;Gersand;Chambi;pYzou;Coralieandco;marnault;Emilie;Philou;MelanieGeffroy;magalimariani;achevrel;magalbrun;Carole;Margaux;Blandine;Mathilde	alban EDOUARD-ARMAND;Florent Masson;Sandra OKALA;Gaël Chambonnier;Pierre-Yves Zundel;Coralie VIOLLET;Mathilde ARNAULT;Emilie Poller;Philippe Thomas;Mélanie Geffroy;Magali Mariani;anne chevrel;Marie-Amedee Galbrun;Carole Rabouille;Jaulin Margaux;Blandine Deschamps;Mathilde GUZZO	sboumahdi	Soufiane Boumahdi	BBa_K342000	BBa_K342999

Anyone who wants to enjoy bathing in natural bodies of water in or near areas populated by humans or livestock may encounter unsafe levels of enteric bacteria.  Contemporary methods of assessing water quality have a slow turn-around time so we have taken steps to perfect a biosensor for rapidly indirectly quantifying the presence of enteric bacteria in natural water samples through the detection of quorum sensing factors.  Previous IGEMS have exploited the LuxR/pLux system for the detection of a variety of N-acylhomoserine lactone autoinducers. We have taken steps to further perfect a biosensor based on this device by transforming a gram-positive bacteria host to eliminate any background autoinducer signal and to build-in an enzymatic 'read-out' to obtain an analog output.  We envision the development of a handheld monitor that uses this IGEM biosensor, immobilized on input paper strips, to rapidly detect unsafe levels of enteric bacteria in water samples.	geotwaddle	George Twaddle	None	None	mentash	Amro Mentash	None	None	Joehull;dgarvey;SusanYang;rchamberlin;ChanceTheChase;h.caparell	Joseph Hull;dylan garvey;Hun Young Yang;Rachelle Chamberlin;Irene Fahrberger;Holly G.

Past iGEM projects have used chemical or optical stimuli to actuate transcriptional responses. Our project, however, seeks to add voltage sensitivity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Baker's yeast was chosen because in some sense yeast have a system that responds to voltage input. With a voltage stimulus one can open the voltage-gated calcium channels of yeast, causing calcium ions to rush into the cytoplasm. This causes calcineurin to dephosphorylate Crz1, which enters the nucleus and binds various promoters. Our group presents a library of characterized Crz1-sensitive promoters of both naturally-occurring and synthetic varieties. Genes downstream of these promoters are thus voltage-regulated in media containing calcium.	oster@jhu.edu	Marc Ostermeier	None	None	caiyizhi;doctorbee54	Yizhi Cai;Jef Boeke	None	None	jrporter;AndrewSnavely;arjunkhakhar;zguo7;nyoung;SunPenguin;Jlemoel;Danielwolozny;hma7;rpassar3;kboulier	Justin Porter;Andrew Snavely;Arjun Khakhar;Zheyuan Guo;Noah Young;Ang Andy Tu;Jonathan LeMoel;Daniel Wolozny;Henry Ma;Roberto Passaro;Kristin Boulier	None	None	BBa_K363000	BBa_K363999

Detecting these heavy metals is an important task. So we designed a heavy-metal-detecting E. coli. In order to design the system, we employed two fluorescence proteins (GFP, RFP) and aryl acylamidase as signal reporters. The aryl acylamidase converts a colorless acetaminophen(Tylenol TM) to a brown color substrate. Since the detecting E. coli has three heavy metal promoters, if more than two heavy metals coexist in a solution, the E. coli emit mixed fluorescence, so we simultaneously detect metals. Our goal is to synthetic modules put these three genes for different heavy metals in a row in E. coli and then utilized in the form of a lyophilized powder, which can be stored in a drug capsule to make it portable so that analysis of water is easily processed.

For controlling cell death, we designed 'Lysisbox' consists of a pair of modules: 'Killer gene' and 'Anti-killer gene.' As the Killer gene for E.coli, we noted the lysis cassette [SRRz/Rz1gene] of lambda phage coding for a holin and an endolysin. The holin forms pores in the inner membrane, and the endolysin access to and degrade the peptidoglycan by passing through the pores, leading the E.coli to death. As the Anti-killer gene, we chose S-TMD1 coding for a dominant-negative holin that inhibits the formation of the fatal pores. The balance of these two genes expression level has a key of the E.Coli's life or death. In addition, such controllable membrane pores must show critical functions for all living organisms with lipid membranes.

We are targeting catechol for degradation into common metabolic intermediates of the Krebs Cycle by using xylE from Pseudomonas putida that codes for the protein catechol-2,3-dioxygenase.  Catechol-2,3-dioxygenase is being targeted into microcompartments, formed by engineered Aquifex aeolicus protein, lumazine synthase, to reduce cross-talk and increase concentration.  The complex will then be purified and applied to the tailings for catechol degradation.  By funnelling other pathways through catechol we can develop efficient methods for the decontamination of the tailings ponds.  Mms6 from Magnetospirillum magneticum removes heavy metals from solution by forming nanoparticles.  The Mms6 protein will be secreted from the cell into the tailings for the removal of metals such as iron and cobalt for creating an efficient bioremediation process.

These crystal proteins are toxic to certain types of mosquitoes and are not pathogenic to mammals.

One, we want our highlight to be the first team to provide the iGEM registry with stress-inducible promoters to be used in plants. These promoters can be valuable tools in monitoring the environment for salt, heavy metals, temperature, and more. Second, we want to develop a real-time monitoring model of these stress-inducible promoters by having fluorescent reporters linked to their expression. Current research typically uses microarray, a technique that takes a 'snapshot' of a system, where as we want to hold a 'video camera' up to specific genes. Third, we will show the advantages of using Nicotiana tabacum protoplasts (NT cells). Our NT cell system provides a faster, cheaper, and safer method of obtaining a transgenic plant model than transforming an actual plant, benefits future iGEM teams may want to take into consideration.

BacillaFilla would be applied to structures by spraying onto their surface. The Bacillus swims deep into the microcracks. Repair is effected by production of CaCO3, filamentous cells and Levansucrose. CaCO3 expands at the same rate as concrete, making it the ideal filler. A filamentous cell mesh provides reinforcement. Levansucrose glues CaCO3 and filamentous cells in place. B. subtilis 168 sporulates, making it ideal for storage and transportation. The cells are naturally tolerant to concrete's high pH. We repaired 168's defective swrA and sfp, regaining motility. At the end of the crack the quorum communication peptide subtilin triggers a co-ordinated population response from a subtilin-inducible promoter. Upregulating SR1 and rocF promotes arginine and urea production, increasing exogenous  CaCO3 deposition. Over-producing  yneA induces  the filamentous cell phenotype, while SacB converts extracellular sucrose to levansucrose glue.	naw3	Anil Wipat	None	None	njsh2	Jennifer Hallinan	None	None	shethharsh08;Daye;swoodhouse;jannetta;RachelBoyd;alankoh;Yessa;PhilipHall;deenatsu	Harsh Jayesh Sheth;Da Ye;Steven Woodhouse;Jannetta Steyn;Rachel May Boyd;Alan Koh;Younus Essa;Philip Hall;Deena Tsu	stachopeter;matthew.pocock;wendysmith	Jem Stach;Matthew Pocock;Wendy Smith	BBa_K302000	BBa_K302999

Like keratin in skin, it comprises the protective outer layer of these animals. Our chitin expression platform involves generating a layer of chitin from a lawn of bacteria in response to an external molecular cue. This cue induces chitin synthesis (fast) and cell lysis (slow). This system allows for a build-up of chitin followed by cell lysis and subsequent release into the top layer of the lawn. Abrasions expose cells to the external cue for self-repair. In this way, we create a regenerative chitin biolayer with potential medical and industrial applications.

Our goal is to speed up the reporting response of bacterial gene expression through shortening the time needed for routine iGEM experiments. We intend to construct systems aimed at reducing experimental time and increasing efficiency of construction production. To achieve the goal, our design process is split up into three parts: Riboswitch, mRNA Binding, and SsrA. (1) Riboswitch - faster production of proteins by inducing the translation of pre-transcribed RNA molecules. (2) mRNA Binding - using mRNA aptamers and split GFP/RFP-eIF4A reporter systems to show faster promoter activity or the expression of mRNA transcripts. (3) SsrA - fast, specific, and constitutive proteolysis achieved by engineering fluorescent proteins with LVA tags.	nymuchang	Chuan-Hsiung Chang	None	None	Smoox	Chien-Tsun Chen	None	None	z2567989;v225522;erich060;igemget1;sy103179;ltd2001;bl7wh;bjobjo;k45204113;yohoho;nobloodwar;hiiamlala;Lucy;littlebow;Tomny;Brace;waken;duncan6502;Jessey;clint;barry50710;NickLai;inconnuspigeon;bigwolf;YPJ;SyueLiang;yutong	Chun-Hao Hsieh;Po-Hsiang Liao;Eric Po-Yu Huang;Zong Min Lin;Yu - Ju Chen;Yi-Fan Chen;Shih-Ying Wang;Heng-Jai Liu;Yong-Yu, Jhan;Chien-Tzu Tseng;Geng Ming Su;Yen-Chen Lin;Chia-Hua Ho;Po-chin Wu;HUNG, YU-SHENG;Yun-Ting Shih;Chuan-Sin Wu;Cheng-Ting Lin;chien-jung Guo;KO KUEI YUEH;Po-Yu Chen;CHUN-YU LAI;JO-YU FENG;Ying Hsien Lee;Ping-Ju You;Syue Liang , Lin;Tan Shun Yu	eyelight;LFYeh;blackrabbit	Yen-Kuang Chen;Li Feng Yeh;Jesse Wu	BBa_K411000	BBa_K411999

Rhamnolipids as biosurfactants are important in the remediation of oil spill areas. The cleanup of the Exxon Valdez oil spill using rhamnolipids as biosurfactants was too expensive and complicated, therefore impractical for large-scale bioremediation. However, with advances genetic engineering and synthetic biology offer a viable solution to oil spill pollution clean up. In this project we use genetic engineering as a tool to integrate genetic parts through the BioBrick assembly standard protocol of iGEM to develop a BioBrick for rhamnosiltransferase 1 complex (rhlAB) gene expression in Escherichia coli for standardized rhamnolipid production. Our BioBrick integrates a promoter, a RBS (ribosomal binding site), our part rh1AB gene sequence isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a GFP reporter and a terminator. All the parts fit into a plasmid backbone that can be transformed into E. coli strains, which can then produce rhamnolipids.

Past attempts at developing counters in cells have mostly attempted to mimic the binary methods that computers use to count.Our first counter takes a new approach to counting in cells, essentially a mechanical rotary counter implemented on a micro scale.  Each time the counter detects an input, it performs an excision and integration directly down-stream of the active site, turning on a reporter and rotating over one 'notch' on the counter.Our second counter operates on the wholly different principle that the statistical occurrence of a rare event in a large population can be modeled.  Each cell in our population harbors a construct that when stimulated has a small chance of excising a terminator and expressing a resistance gene.  The number of resistant cells is thus an accurate count of the number of input stimuli.	ablindner	Ariel Lindner	None	None	YangYifan;ericmeltzer	Yang Yifan;Eric Meltzer	None	None	adecrulle;Aleksandra;xduportet;StephP;arichard;rpantier;theotime;Léadixon	Antoine Decrulle;Aleksandra Nivina;Xavier Duportet;Stéphane PINHAL;Alexandre Richard;Raphael Pantier;Théotime Calandra;Léa Dixon	david.bikard;ascoquel;tlombes	David Bikard;coquel anne-sophie;Thomas Lombes	BBa_K329000	BBa_K329999

First of all, we analyzed the function, structure and operation of the transcription factor MerR, a mercury-responsive regulator in detail via bioware experiments and modeling. Then appropriate topology candidates for proper bioreporters were carefully searched. We selected a candidate and re-designed genetic components to accomplish certain bioreporter function in need, which was verified by following bioware experiments. For bioabsorbents, we engineered MerR into a metal binding peptide. This was followed by inductive expression of engineered peptide on surface, periplasm and cytosol of E.coli. This reverse engineering method was then expanded to lead-responsive regulator, PbrR, to confirm the validness of this method. Results demonstrated that the procedure mentioned above is streamlined enough to construct valid whole-cell bioreporters and bioabsorbents of various heavy metals for field application in the near future.	qiPku	Qi Ouyang	None	None	None	None	None	None	May;lgdeer;Eastsea;Crystal;JjunyiJiao;xteng;Spring_zhq;wqz;starshine;Cathterry;evamonlight;Huyang;DragonKnight;Simenhomer;kitties;Nancy;Joo;miaoconfectioner0314	Mei Chen;Lu Yuheng;Donghai Liang;Ao Liu;Junyi Jiao;Xin Teng;Haoqian Zhang;Qianzhu Wu;miao jing;Weiye Wang;Zhenzhen Yin;Yang Hu;Heng Pan;Boxuan Zhao;Ying Sheng;Zairan Liu;Zhu Tianze;Yiwei Chen	None	None	BBa_K346000	BBa_K346999

To monitor these processes we created and oxygen bio-sensor in E. coli which produces an anaerobic fluorescent protein.  The task of creating an oxygen bio-sensor is compounded by the fact that oxygen diffusion through many substances is very limited; so oxygen contamination can be undetected due to a response which is too 'soft' . To combat this, we enabled our sensor to induce this response in non-oxygenated bacteria via the lux system; thus amplifying the signal and producing a bio-alarm which is sufficiently 'loud' to not be missed.  To accomplish this goal we characterized the response characteristics of the many different Lux components in the parts-distribution.

We proposed two synthetic-biological approaches to OA, one with a eukaryotic genetic circuit and another prokaryotic. Both circuits are composed of three systems: 'Detector', 'Actuator' and 'Supervisor'. As for Detector, we built tissue-specific promoters in the eukaryotic circuit, while inflammation factors are employed as signals of OA in the prokaryotic circuit. The same Actuator shared by two circuits generates proteins col2a1, which replenishes the degraded matrix, and oct4, which reverses the disordered differentiation. The eukaryotic Supervisor part has an original design in which a photo-sensitive cation channel crosstalks with certain cellular signaling pathways, resulting in the light-controlled expression of col2a1 and oct4; in the counterpart of prokaryotic circuit, both injected inducers and over-population lead the engineered bacteria to suicide, thus attenuating possible side effects.	helin	Lin He	None	None	magang	Gang Ma	None	None	Anything;biohyp;rosalyn;AmandaZhao;kaidou;amarantine;Latte;k_omobomax;cindyxwd;Dennis*C;PatrickH.C.;liuyuanbird;menglong;foreverycc;chenlibin	Zhe Shen;He Yupeng;Yueling Zhou;Qing Zhao;Chuan Shan;Yue Duan;Chen Ma;Shengdi Li;Wendi Xu;Han Zhu;Chen Huang;Yuan Liu;Menglong Zeng;Chenchen Yang;Libin Chen	None	None	BBa_K387000	BBa_K387999

However, many important biological processes are governed by the ratio between the concentrations of multiple chemicals. To create systems capable of responding to more complex input data, the Stanford team designed two types of ratio-measuring sensors. The first sensor utilizes two unique small RNAs to inhibit the transcription of two operons, each responding to an environmental factor and having a specific flourescent protein (or output gene). By manipulating the number of small RNAs produced, a tipping point between outputs can be established for different input ratios. The second sensor uses a phosphorylatable protein to control the transcription rate of an output promoter. By linearly associating two chemical inputs to the production of a kinase and a phosphatase, the ratio of the two environmental factors indirectly dictates the activity of the output promoter.	drew	Drew Endy	None	None	csmolke	Christina Smolke	None	None	axva1663;cbrunson;ocsicnarf;karpadillo;GregOwen	Alejandro Virrueta;Christopher Brunson;Francisco Cai;Karina Padilla;Gregory Owen	chrisvanlang;isist;anshurama;drummstikk;alc;rayka;rjbloom;stpierre	Christopher C VanLang;Isis Trenchard;Anusuya Ramasubramanian;Graham A.

We have focused on vitiligo in where pigment cells are destroyed, resulting in white patches on the skin. Studies have shown that vitiligo patients have decreased levels of antioxidants and elevated levels of antibodies targeting the pigment cells in the skin. We have used synthetic biology to fuse cell-penetrating peptides to proteins that are deficient in skin of vitiligo patients. The cell-penetrating peptides will aid in passing the proteins through the skin and target the pigment cells to reach repigmentation. Currently there are no treatments like ours for vitiligo patients. However, we strongly believe that synthetic biology can help bacteriotherapy getting a major role in fighting several skin disorders in the future, and that our first explorations in this field inspires others to continue exploring.

To lessen its metabolic burden, the system should respond to low concentrations of autoinducer produced by V. cholerae and co-ordinate this response using the Lux quorum-sensing system. We have explored rearranging the network architecture of the Lux system to give bistable expression. A model to describe bistability was formed using ODEs and implemented in C++. To assess the perception of synthetic biology, software was written to gather data from social networking and news sites and quantify the change in opinions with time.	vannesmith	V Anne Smith	None	None	pythonhat;olipops;jbom;hooley	Wim Verleyen;Olivia Mendivil Ramos;John Mitchell;Chris Hooley	None	None	fsalimi;L7ukas;JWTaylor;RachaelBlackburn;Ally_m;D;patrickolden;jaunty;SarahS	Fatemeh Salimi;Lukas Ly;James Ward Taylor;Rachael Blackburn;Alasdair Morton;C David Owen;Patrick Olden;Jonathan Ward;Sarah Shapiro	Oli	Olivia Mendivil Ramos	BBa_K356000	BBa_K356999

The first bacterial reporters appeared 20 years ago, although these early tests didn't use genetically modified microorganisms. Further research and development in the area of genetic engineering has resulted in newer and more sophisticated bacterial sensors, capable of detecting the presence of contaminants, sugars and amino acids in different media such as soil and water. However, most bacterial sensors can only detect the presence of a compound at a certain concentration and currently there are few documented bacterial sensors that can detect and report different concentrations of the compound of interest. Our objective was to develop a genetic frame, compatible with the BioBrick standard, for the creation of a concentration-sensitive bacterial sensor. In the process we also developed and characterized BioBricks for two new families of phage activators.

The EcoTanker takes up a target compound from the environment and delivers it to a desired location for easy harvesting. The target compound is taken up and stored inside the cell in an EcoTank, a bacterial microcompartment (pduABJKNU). Blue light then directs the delivery of the 'cargo' to a desired destination by phototaxis, using the N. pharaonis blue light responsive domain (NpSRII-NpHtrII-Tar) linked to an E. coli two component system. The EcoTankers are then signaled by green light to self-aggregate and autolyse in response to quorum sensing. We can then easily collect the EcoTanks filled with the target compound, which could be an environmentally toxic substance or an industrially desirable chemical. We expect that EcoTanker to be a powerful machine in various bioremediation and industrial applications.	stef	Stefano Ferri	None	None	japanssun;Kamome;TUKA;abekou;Aptaman	Jihoon Kim;Yoshihiko NONAKA;Kaori TSUKAKOSHI;Koichi Abe;Kazunori IKEBUKURO	None	None	Nasa;maia;Yuta;fukaya;Yoshiyuki;taiki;Aki;Atsuro;Rei;Yasuhiko;hira;Youhei;Tomohiko;sachiko;yosuke;KenZ;nakaji;Naga	Nasa SAVORY;Maia Inoue;Yuta Sakai;Takahiro Fukaya;Yoshiyuki MURAKAMI;Taiki Saito;Aki Kezuka;Atsuro Tatsumi;Rei Toda;Yasuhiko SASAKI;Daisuke HIRAOKA;Youhei Horaguchi;Tomoihko oshige;sachiko ANDO;Yosuke Onishi;Kenji Kakubori;Mitsuharu Nakajima;Daichi NAGAE	MahiMahi	Koji Sode	BBa_K317000	BBa_K317999

Firstly, two cells have different types of antibiotic-resistance, however this expression is repressed in absence of outer stimulation. Two factors of stimulation, cell density and light, are required at once to activate the antibiotic resistance. We took advantage of photoregulation system (Cph1-EnvZ) to make sure downstream promoter is activated with light. This promoter is followed by circuit designed to sense the cell density of its counterpart and activate the counterpart cell's antibiotic-resistant gene.

However, extracting the hydrocarbons requires large volumes of water which are then contaminated with naphthenic acids, heavy metals and residual hydrocarbons.  These 'tailings' are acutely toxic to higher organisms, though some bacteria and algae can survive in these environs.  Our knowledge of metabolic pathways capable of degrading such contaminants (bioremediation) is limited.  However, the known pathways tend to be slow and inefficient.  The breakdown of many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons generates a common intermediate, catechol that is further degraded to Acetyl-CoA.  Metabolic channeling is an effect whereby intermediates are shuttled between enzymes in a pathway circumventing free diffusion into the cytosol.  Here, we present a design, modeling and baseline experiments aimed at demonstrating optimization of catechol degradation using the principle of metabolic channeling in an E. coli proof of concept system.	gcromar	Graham Cromar	None	None	disable1987;aminzia	Kris Hon;Amin Zia	None	None	akapadia;FR;Elena_P;mmmyan;dragonyen19	Anish Kapadia;Farhan;Elena Pasko;Mengyan Li;Yen Leung	K.Zhan;ddewong;Stacy Hung;jparkin	Kenny Zhan;Daniel Wong;Stacy Hung;John Parkinson	BBa_K357000	BBa_K357999

Biopharmaceuticals are commonly synthesized using E. coli as production chassis.

The UCL iGEM team aims to create 'independent' cells in which the production phase is triggered by an external stimulus, removing the need for IPTG.  The stationary phase growth in bioreactors is preceded by a dip in dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) followed by a DOT spike. We have developed a genetic circuit in which a series of promoters will cause the production to be triggered by the hypoxic condition. This auto-induction promises an economically and manufacturing improved production of biopharmaceuticals. There is the potential of applying this 'Pavlovian' circuit principle in near future to yeast, mammalian or other expression systems for the production of complex biomolecules for the treatment of major diseases.	ucbekkm	Eli Keshavarz-Moore	None	None	DNesbeth	Darren Nesbeth	None	None	davinat;zcbcd06;zcbee12;Memecy;jameswbrown;dbrindley;v.raszler;elenapal;a.abed;ali.albazergan;davidbennett;cmoujaes3;cmoujaes	Natasha Davie;Xiang Chen;Omar El Saidi;Mariam Awlia;James Brown;Dave Brindley;Veronika Raszler;Elena Pallari;Arif Abed;Ali-Albazergan Ali;david bennett;Carolina  Moujaes;Carolina Moujaes	None	None	BBa_K301000	BBa_K301999

Regardless of their scope, these messengers are constrained to a system; eg: even far reaching couriers such as hormones are bound within the chemical structure that is the human body. But this is about to change. In this project, our goal is to render the chemical barrier deprecated by using a non-chemical herald: photons. These will transport information between our engineered cells, creating a photon-based inter-cellular communication system. These messengers are produced through bio-luminescent reactions, and are quite capable of traversing multiple environments. This enables the transmission of information beyond the chemical, biological, and even spatial limitations. As the courier is effectively decoupled from the chemical layer, it is an innovative step in establishing communications between organic-based and silicon-based systems, such as computers.

The production  process still has several drawbacks affecting cost/efficiency. In this work, three modular systems were designed to overcome some of these bottlenecks. A library of self-inducible promoters was built and characterized to start the peptide production at a desired culture density, without expensive inducer molecules. Two standard integrative vectors were realized to insert BioBrick parts in user-defined positions of E. coli or S. cerevisiae genome, to ensure genetic stability without using selection markers. Finally, two promising techniques were combined for an 'in-cell' protein purification: PolyHydroxyAlkanoate (PHA) granules were used as a substrate for PHA-binding peptides (Phasins) fused to the target protein, thus replacing affinity resins/columns and tags, while a pH-based self-cleaving peptide (Intein) was used instead of a protease cleavage site. These solutions are modular and provide useful BioBrick parts for other applications.	magni	Paolo Magni	None	None	Cusella	Cusella Gabriella	None	None	Neuro;baren;Chiara;manu.zocco;nickpv;sara2010;fedesampi	Alessandro Ranieri;Riccardo Barini;Chiara Tassorelli;Manuel Zocco;Nicolò Politi;Sara Bisi;Federica Sampietro	lor18;Susanna;Manuel7d9;Matteo;110hs	Lorenzo Pasotti;Susanna Zucca;Manuel Lupotto;Matteo Meroso;Giacomo Zambianchi	BBa_K300000	BBa_K300999

We aim to solve this issue by contributing a library of well-characterized yeast toggle switch components with varying dynamics. In order to characterize these switches, each of the two repressors, driven by mutually repressible promoters, is tagged with a distinct fluorescent protein that can be detected and quantified using flow cytometry. To expand the BioBrick database we will submit functionally-tested yeast-enhanced fluorescent proteins, repressors, and a library of repressible promoters. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of these components in fine tuning genetic networks, we hope to use these toggle switches to build a DNA damage sensor with varying levels of sensitivity. We also describe novel methods for BioBrick construction based on natural homologous recombination mechanisms in S. cerevisiae.	mkaern	Mads Kaern	None	None	None	None	None	None	aazizi;morto077;Justoutofhighschool;csun098;ceule085@uottawa.ca;radizinoviev;mlynn55;djedrysiak	Afnan Azizi;Matthew Orton;Samantha Graitson;Candyce Sun;Chris Euler;Radi Zinoviev;Michael Lynn;Daniel Jedrysiak	None	None	BBa_K319000	BBa_K319999

However, since in most cases bacteria are not drawn towards their targets, the possibility of specific interaction is limited to those bacterial cells that randomly collide with the surface, thus requiring a high bacterial population to achieve efficient targeting. On the other hand, most bacteria are specifically attracted by gradients of a variety of chemicals, thus achieving high cell densities in the areas where the chemoattractants are present at higher concentration. The aim of 'Bacterial Crowding' is to exploit chemotaxis for directing a relatively small population of bacteria to interact efficiently with a non-diffusible target exposed on a biotic or abiotic surface.	fgovrom	Fernando Govantes	None	None	lmercab	Luis Merino	None	None	Freymar;Adrian;efercac;Paola;dcabpra;lepavgom	Félix Reyes Martín;Adrián Arellano Davín;Eva Fernández Cáceres;Paola Gallardo;David Caballero;Luis Eduardo Pavón Gómez	None	None	BBa_K367000	BBa_K367999

We designed a set of concentration detectors that measures different range of the input signal and respond only to a specific concentration interval. By combining and spatio-temporal coordinating such concentration detectors we attempt to construct a biological clock that display time. The concentration band components themselves would work as a quantitative sensor that can work in combination other chemical sensors, such as toxic metals to life saving enzymes, which previous iGEM teams have come up with. Apart from this utility, we believe the concentration band detect sensor in different configurations can allow the creation of complex circuits ranging from simple oscillators to complex data processing machines which can exist on the same system without affecting other components of the system owing to its concentration band specificity.

Thus we design, model and construct a platform for artificial organelles. The shell genes of Citrobacter freundii pdu bacterial microcompartment (BMC) were first constructed into BioBrick parts, assembled and expressed to form an empty porous multi-protein shell of ~100nm. Then target protein can be located either inside or outside the empty shell by fusing the protein with signal sequences, using a novel and convenient assembly standard compatible with the RFC 10. Onto this platform, artificial organelles with different functions can be constructed. With enzymes or binding proteins inside the shell, different nanoreactors or nanoreservoirs can be produced. Modifications outside the shell can be applied to build multi-protein super-complexes or facilitate downstream purification with affinity tags.

However, the successful assembly of organisms that integrate multiple (>3) pieces of information into an elongated AND gate has yet to be seen. Our '4C3 leak-switch' realizes such a tool with the use of homologous recombination and leaky transcriptional terminators. This switch turns on only when three of four types of information are transmitted, regardless of the order of transmission, and outputs differently depending on the combinations of input. Our current project aims at creating bacteria that collectively solve the popular puzzle game Sudoku. This aim is achieved by combining this switch with our second subproject, the 'signal-virus,' which relays information only to the relevant targets, based on an antisense-RNA key system. This system realizes parallel-computing and we believe will greatly advance the field of information-processing.

Upon transformation into Synechocystis, it integrates the device directly into the genome through homologous recombination. We utilized genes that were activated under a variety of conditions, from those responding to heat stress to ones oscillating under a circadian rhythm.

The proposal is that dark yeast cells retain the arriving radiation and heat the surface. But, once the temperature reaches its optimum on the planetary surface the color production should be switched off. In order to achieve that and taking advantage of Synthetic Biology principles, a switch based on prion proteins (on mad yeast!) will be used. The work will be complemented with the implementation of the expression of  LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) 'antifreeze' protein.

This project demonstrates these capabilities through experimentation and modeling.  Another candidate for reapplying an electronic engineering technique is the codesign of hardware and software to implement a function.   In synthetic biology, codesign might mean implementing a design spec in different expression control regimes and comparing their relative merits.  Our work examines the codesign concept by constructing an AND gate in three different design domains.  We explore the application of these ideas with an environmental sensor.

Invasin causes uptake of the bacterium into the mammalian cell by induction of endocytosis. Bacterial cells are lysed in the endosome and then LLO is released. LLO is a pore-forming toxin which causes endosomal membrane disruption and release of the payload (either protein or DNA) into cytoplasm of the mammalian cell. In order to fine-tune expression of genes used in our project we conducted measurement of various RBS parts included in 2010 spring distribution both from Community and Anderson's collections.

In this project, the concept of a whole-cell biosensor has been adapted for medical use as a diagnostic for viral infection through engineering a commensal bacterium. Lactobacilli are the predominant commensal organisms in the human vaginal mucosa and are ideally placed to detect the presence of a sexually transmitted infection, such as Human Papillomavirus. A strain of this bacterium has been modified to produce a chromogenic reporter, which is visible to the naked eye, when 'switched on' through exposure to the input signal (viral infection). However, in order for this to be clearly visible in vivo, this signal needs to be transmitted throughout the entire bacterial population. Thus, this project focused on a) modifying a Gram-positive bacterium to produce the chromogenic reporter; b) using a heterologous quorum-sensing mechanism to propagate an auto-regulated feedback loop amongst a bacterial population.	rsparrow	Raymond Sparrow	None	None	rumbold;madigoem;Marco_Weinberg;RobertKowalenko	Karl Rumbold;Ezekiel Madigoe;Marco Weinberg;Robert Kowalenko	None	None	ByronJacobs;Chelle;Liam_Wilson;Langa;Greg_M;Shaun_Burd	Byron Jacobs;Michelle Robinson;Liam Wilson;Langelihle Ntloko;Gregory Meyer;Shaun Christopher Burd	LauraMillroy;Youtaro;RobynB	Laura Millroy;Youtaro Shibayama;Robyn Brackin	BBa_K354000	BBa_K354999

We first built a mathematical model to quantitatively predict RIPS (ribosome initiation per sec) of any given coding sequence in any organism. We then constructed three modules (synonymous substitution, optimization and RIPS design) to process input coding sequences. Bach could recompose the input sequence into an output one that better suits the host organism and performs the specific translational rate of desire. In this way, the discordant tunes of codon bias in biobricks from different genetic backgrounds could be synchronized, and the realization of a more predictable and robust system would be possible. Our work not only benefits current works involving exogenous protein expression, but also makes a big step towards standardization and characterization of biobricks.	mingchen	Ming Chen	None	None	wumin	wu min	None	None	demonfool;sherryweihao;JiaLi;SirGreedy;wilson;goodboy;WendyHu;ju.mekey;Thorondor;huayijie;tyotakuki;robertying;andrewpal;wenchao;fatestudio;Mercury;supersally;Leo.M;Edward;Vincere	ZHU Kan;Wei Hao;Jia Li;LI Ye;ZHAO Cong;Yang Haocheng;HU Chenyue;Mimi Zhu;JING ZHAO;Hua Yijie;ZHANG Zhuohui;Guoyuan Ying;Shaohua Wang;Song Wenchao;Zhou Qin;ZHAO Junjie;Li Yao;Ma Lie;Cui Yunpeng;Xia Yu	yinggangyan	Yinggang Yan	BBa_K402000	BBa_K402999

This kind of mechanism provides a nearly real-time control over genes, which could provide advantages in variety of industrial bioprocesses.    Inspired by the principles of open source software, we introduce an Open Sequence business model implemented around our switch. We want to encourage future companies to create Open Sequence based solutions and to empower customers to participate in the product development. Open Sequence model’s transparency as well as lower degree of protection raises trust and continuity and benefits larger community.

As the coffee berries are digested, bitter components of the coffee bean are broken down. Later, the beans are cleaned, roasted, and brewed to make the Kopi Luwak coffee.  The problem with the procedure today is that farming industries keeps tens of thousands of civets living in battery cages, and force-feeds them only coffee berries. As a result of the treatment, the Asian Palm Civet population is declining.  We propose to make this process humane, efficient, and sanitary by instead using bacteria to produce the coffee. We will accomplish this by genetically engineering E. coli with genes for various digestive enzymes, thus simulating the digestive process of the civets with coffee berries so we can finally save the Asian Palm Civets.	amathieu	Aaron Mathieu	None	None	None	None	None	None	17kapoora;15kuffnerc;17malim;15pervierb;16joism;16yaow;17taussigc;16jawahart;barryhuang123;iGem5S;17liuk;Bstern15;15hongj;16huangw;VChen;anushapurakayastha;16sahoor	Akash Kapoor;Chris Kuffner;Mayank Mali;Benjamin Pervier;Madhuri Jois;Wynne Yao;Charles Taussig;Tara Jawahar;Barry Huang;Rachel Tao;Katherine Liu;Ben Stern;Justin Hong;William Huang;Victoria Chen;Anusha Purakayastha;Roshni Sahoo	None	None	BBa_K1261000	BBa_K1261999

Using a wax esterase, fatty acids and ethanol, both naturally produced by E. coli, can be combined to form biodiesel. However, E. coli uses the same intermediate products to produce both fatty acids and ethanol, which reduces the efficiency of this process. This problem can be avoided by engineering two different strains of E. coli to work in tandem. One strain will be engineered to produce free fatty acids (FFA) through expression of enzymes including as TesA and acc. The other strain will be engineered to produce ethanol through expression of enzymes including pdc and adhB. These two products will be combined in one of the two cells using a waxy esterase, producing the final biodiesel product. Cooperative production will hopefully produce more ethanol than current single strain methods using E. coli.	kahaynes	Karmella Haynes	None	None	xiaowang;nielsendr	Xiao Wang;David Nielsen	None	None	mykema;stashmore94;vsomayaj;sirbedevire;mgwaddin	Matthew Ykema;Scott Ashmore;Vallari Somayaji;David Reynolds;Michael Waddington	ksstanda;Rene.Davis	Kylie Standage-Beier;Rene M.

This objective has created a network of open-ponds for algae production, dispersed across the southwest of the United States. As synthetic biology moves out of the lab into the wild, what are the ecological effects associated with the release of a modified organism?    Car Pools is a series of simulations that examine potential ecological effects associated with the public release of modified algae for biofuel production. The project draws on current open-pond algae production methods to imagine a future fuel-pool infrastructure for Los Angeles, a metropolis built for cars and where there are more than 43,000 swimming pools.

Up to now, the number one cause of death worldwide is caused by ischemia and related conditions such as heart attack or stroke. It is needed to regard the big picture of the condition in order to solve the problem. In our project, our will is to build two different devices, which work synergistically, to fix these two distinct situations. We decided to use ‘’hypoxia inducible systems” and ‘’reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensitive gene fragments’’.

Typically, expansion occurs via reassignment of the amber stop codon.  When reassigned, this codon results in incorporation of a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) not normally found in proteins.  Such ncAAs can grant new functionality, including photocrosslinking, photocaging, novel bonding or binding sites, and fluorescence.  One part of our project creates an “Expansion Pack Reporter Kit”.  This kit uses a fused fluorescent reporter, containing an N-terminal RFP domain, a C-terminal GFP domain, and an amber codon-containing linker sequence that connects the two domains.  While the RFP domain is translated and fluoresces under all conditions, the GFP domain is only translated when the ncAA is incorporated within the linker.  Failure to incorporate the ncAA leads to translation termination, and thus no GFP fluorescence.  This allows us to accurately assess the rate and fidelity of ncAA incorporation.	jbarrick	Jeffrey Barrick	None	None	Zen_Blade	Dennis Mishler	None	None	jordanmonk;katemortensen;nathanshin;Ew6977;algutz	Jordan Monk;Catherine Mortensen;Nathan Shin;Ella Watkins;Alejandro Gutierrez	mhammerling	Michael Hammerling	BBa_K1416000	BBa_K1416999

A seemingly simple and non-invasive mechanism for this remote control is the use of magnetic fields.  By altering the iron homeostasis of E. coli, we want to increase the total iron level of the cytosol. By sequestering iron in a ferritin protein, iron crystals are formed and the cell is detoxified.   We will work with other metal binding proteins such as metallothioneins and phytochelatin synthases in order to create ferromagnetic crystals. Furthermore, we will search for the optimal conditions which yield the most efficient formation of magnetic nanoparticles in E. coli. Once we have discovered the best way to magnetize E. coli bacteria, we will build and characterize suitable BioBricks that can be used to remote control the cellular movement of E. coli.

Astronauts have been sent to outer space. In the meantime, how to prevent radiation harm has become a serious problem that demands promting solution.  Our project focuses on establishing a more portable, accurate and economical biosynthetic system to detect the dosage, and to provide measurement precisely to guard human from being hurt by invisible radiation. We assembly gene circuits in E.coli, which function as radiation detector and reporter individually. Meanwhile, we design bi-switch circuits for the detector, a quorum sensing circuits for reporter and a linkage between the two. Once the detector senses radiation by the damage, the linkage auto-inducer molecules will drive the reporter to produce light and digital signals.  We firmly believe that this biological-activity-based detector system is more sensitive, and has more significant influence in measuring the level of harm by sensing the dosage of radiation.	qinghong1	Hong Qing	None	None	yifeiwang;hongma;XuefeilLv	Yifei Wang;Hong Ma;Xuefei Lv	None	None	CharMoon;YeChen;manchester;NanZhang;Flair;YJQiu;Dongya111;MengDiYao;AlecWang;liangxi627;xiaolu;Cait.z;leomuch;domingo;sherly;Biowhat;DayanZhang;xieyujie;stoneSYJ;Tuphie;Xiaojuan;liubianshi;belief_yijie;Junya	Zhang Deyu;Ye Chen;Da Song;Nan Zhang;Yunlong Fan;Yunjie Qiu;Dongya Hou;MengDi Yao;Wang Pengju;Xi Liang;Pan Lu;Yimin Tan;Maoqi Liu;XingJian Zhang;YinTong Chen;Di Peng;Dayan Zhang;Yujie Xie;Yuanjie Shi;Yifei Lee;Xiaojuan Cai;chunxia qin;Jie Yi;Junya Wu	lkf1013;RunhongRay;qinkuiwei;Yiming_Dong	Liu Kefu;Runhong Lei;Qin Kuiwei;Yiming Dong	BBa_K1407000	BBa_K1407999

This bio-lock, likened to a digital combination lock, allows bacteria to grow only if three different inducers as password is put in order. To realize the code function three layered AND logic gates combined with sRNA system are built up. The corresponding sRNA selectively inhibits gene expression in AND gates to control the order of the password. MIN system is re-designed to inhibit cell division, which will be turned on to maintain the strain to a low density. In a word, locked bacteria are allowed to grow only when the input is correct; thus strains would remain low density and are effectively locked up. Therefore, commercially valuable or potentially hazardous strains will be under more strict control with different customized E.co-Locks.	bitlichun	Chun Li	None	None	JasperCity;bitguosy	Jun Li;Shuyuan Guo	None	None	JiangNS;JIAhaiyang;Strider;ztjbit;biotar;coffee528;Mengxin;yimi;WangYQ;Gaonan;ElPsyCongroo;Mingming;chongchong;allenJian;LiJinlinT.K.;Rambo;xbjmh;yujiazhao;houhuilongfei;EVA1992;YaHang;answey;491508976@qq.com	NiSi Jiang;JIA Haiyang;Baiyang Liu;Tengjiang Zhang;Chenyi Li;Ke Xu;Xin Meng;Huan sun;Yunqian Wang;Nan Gao;Zhong Wan;Mingming Cao;Wenxin Bai;Xing Jian;Jinlin Li;Zongzhi Lv;Bing Xiao;Yujia Zhao;Hui Hou;Luan Yinan;Hang Ya;Lei Siyu;Guanghua Qing	Genlin	Genlin Zhang	BBa_K1325000	BBa_K1325999

This recipe, or workflow, integrates software tools to reduce human error and to structure the way device designs are chosen, assembled, and tested. To demonstrate that this workflow can be used by any level of cloner (beginner, intermediate, and advanced), we will highlight how we used Chimera to create [1] individual genetic parts (namely tandem promoters, fusion proteins, and different backbones), [2] transcriptional units assembled from individual parts (with both new and previously made MoClo parts), and [3] a complex genetic device (our goal is a priority encoder).

Absence of symptoms in early stages leads to a late diagnosis when patients need dialysis or even transplants. Currently, CKD is diagnosed by measuring creatinine levels in blood, which in turn are detectable only at late stages of renal dysfunction as well as are sensitive to factors such as diet, gender, ethnicity, age, muscle mass. We report the development of a biosensor that can diagnosis CKD in its early stages, identifying a biomarker named Cystatin C. Using a cell surface biosensor as detector and quorum-sensing system as transducer and response mechanism, we developed a genetic circuit that establishes a threshold, differentiating concentration ranges of Cystatin C.

Even though this is a natural process industrial-scale farming intensifies the situation. Therefore, finding ways to decrease production of such gases damaging to climate is essential. Considering the 25 times greater contribution to global warming compared to CO2, methane emission is a substantial point of action for future climate protection.  In order to achieve this, we are going to engineer a bacterium in a way  that it is able to render methane harmless just as it originates in the cow’s rumen. The bacterium shall be equipped with the 6 subunits of the monooxygenase (MMO) out of Methylococcus capsulatus turning methane into a natural intermediate of the cellular metabolism so that no methane is released into the atmosphere.

Assays for the production of pyruvate, fatty acids, and alkanes will be used to characterize our system. In addition, we will be determining various environmental conditions that increase the effectiveness of alkane production such as CO2 and O2 limitation.	ekessler	Eric Kessler	None	None	krtuel;jpwhalen	Kelley Tuel;Joseph Whalen	None	None	Aussie9090;Vashu1;ilikepie;meaton02;ajvance;crortbals;Ria_Shome;tychao;Barca;rchan;alramaswamy;jhsingh	Austin Taylor Chick;Vashu Chogada;Nithin Saripalli;Muriel Eaton;Alexis Vance;Chloe Ortbals;Ria Shome;Tiffany Chao;Mark Hattemer;Rosanna Chan;Aiswariya Ramaswamy;Jai Singh	None	None	BBa_K1248000	BBa_K1248999

Estrogens from natural, synthetic, plant, and fungal sources show endocrine disrupting properties and even at low concentrations have harmful effects due to receptor activation. A sensor was constructed using the ligand binding domain of the human estrogen receptor. Estrogenic activity occurs in water sources including waste, drinking, and freshwater. In freshwater, estrogens are harmful to the ecosystems, feminizing fish and disrupting populations of organisms. Additionally, estrogenic substances can be present in what we drink. However, since the presence of hormones in water is a relatively new area of study there have been no previous restrictions or regulations regarding removal of estrogenic compounds. The sensor and fish ecosystems were modeled and middle school outreach kits for Creature Feature and DNA extraction and hybridization were created to demonstrate concepts of synthetic biology.	ctelmer	Cheryl Telmer	None	None	bruchez;natasa_mz	Marcel Bruchez;Natasa Miskov-Zivanov	None	None	nmatamala;dominiquecheylise;acelentano;lenaw;dopeters;nsundara;cpozzi	Nicole Matamala;Dominique MacCalla;Ali Celentano;Lena Wang;Danielle Peters;Niteesh Sundaram;Courtney Pozzi	dianam	Diana Marculescu	BBa_K1491000	BBa_K1491999

We construct E.coli to express RFP to draw a dynamic pattern of snowflake. Once we kindle a spot, the pattern starts and grows up gradually. According to our design, two kinds of E.coli with partly different genetic pathway align alternatively. The two kinds of E.coli interact through two independent quorum sensing systems, LuxI/LuxR/AHL in vibrio fischeri and RpaI/RpaR/pC-HSL in Rhodopseudomonas palustris, while neither of them influencing themselves. A plate for E.coli culture is divided into rectangular grids and every “cell” in the grid is occupied with a colon of E.coli. On-state shows as red fluorescence while off-state shows as nothing illuminating. To kindle the system, we only need to add correspondent signal molecular to the central 4 colons of E.coli in a plate. Finally, there will be a snowflake with red fluorescence starts to grow up from a point automatically.

Each year, the plant purchases 250,000 dollars worth of glycerin, which is used by bacteria to denitrify the water, in order to prevent eutrophication in the Chesapeake Bay. The UVa iGEM team from 2008 created a part which, when added, enables E.Coli to produce polyhydroxybutyrate, a biodegradable, bio-derived plastic. Our project is to make E.Coli that produces this plastic, which the plant could then use this bacteria to create polyhydroxybutyrate, filter out the E Coli, and then use the plastic as an alternative food source for their bacteria, saving them 250,000 dollars per year, as well as giving them a renewable energy source for their plant.

Capture module is in charge of recollecting sodium ions in the water due to the new NhaS gen registered by the team. Aroma module is with the help of salicylic acid, responsible of producing a Winter Green odor that acts as a reporter if the bio-filter is working. Resistance module allows the E. coli to survive in the salty environment of the water, and this allows the bio-filter to works. Finally, the Union module allow the bacterium to joins to a silica pearl, which facilitates the removal of the bacteria from the water.	jeannie05	Jannet Edith Salinas	None	None	hebersco	Heber Torres	None	None	DiegoValadez;ArnulfoAramis;amjg97;MQ;AngieMnL;jlhdza96;FernandaPuente;Jlouz;rapiman96;Piff;chuy_97;lisandro12;oda.ibarra;Marea;adrianrdz;UnicornioMagico;MelyChavez;Antonio09	Diego Ivan Valadez Lozano;Arnulfo Aramis Peña Torres;Andres Marcelo Jimenez Gonzalez;Eva Melissa Quintanar Sánchez;Angelina Griselda Miranda Lara;Jorge Luis Hernandez Ayala;Nancy Fernanda Puente Quintanilla;Joel Abdías Aguilar Orta;Raúl Jorge De La Garza Puente;Irina Romero Guerrero;Jesús Alberto Delgadillo Chapa;Lisandro Hiracheta Torres;Odalisse Carolina Ibarra Clemente;Marina Emilio Aguirre;Adrián Alejandro Rodríguez Rodríguez;Dulce María Valdez López;Ingrid Melissa Chávez de la Portilla;Antonio Cárdenas	lilycn4;ElsaYo;fvarela;maaracelia;manueltjr;Nash	Lilia Nallely Estrada Virrueta;Elsa Yolanda Flores Villa;Felix Alberto Varela Guillen;Maria Aracelia Alcorta García;Manuel Torres Barajas;Nashiely Moreira Vela	BBa_K1255000	BBa_K1255999

With the aim to protect oneself against obesity and debilitating diseases caused by a high-fat diet, we are using a synthetic biology approach to design an Escherichia coli strain (called Fit Coli) that has an enhanced ability to uptake and convert excess fatty acids from fatty foods into a-linolenic acid (ALA). The strategy is to engineer the fadL and fadD genes along with three desaturase genes to facilitate the uptake of long-chain fatty acids and their biotransformation to ALA by the “Fit Coli” strain. It is predicted that the ALA converted from excess fatty acids by Fit Coli is converted to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3-fatty acid, in the human gut, which is well known to have many positive health benefits.	bhrkong	Richard Y.C.

Decades of fire suppression have created large tracts of older pine forest that provide a highway for beetle expansion. The lack of fire, combined with a recent warming trend, means that the beetles are now occurring farther east, farther north and at higher elevations than ever before. This is cause for concern as the mountain national parks form the margin between the beetle outbreak in British Columbia and commercial forests in Alberta.    Our project will focus on building a bacterial plasmid that will produce and secrete the chitinase enzyme which will in turn be able to break down the chitin rich membranes of the BSF while leaving the tree unaffected and thus able to use its own defences to deal with the mountain pine beetle.

Starting with the goal of making microalgae an easier to engineer chassis, we set out to create a specialised toolkit of standardised biological parts. We strove to characterise a complete range of microalgal parts, including promoters, terminators, fluorescent proteins, localisation tags, antibiotic markers, and CRISPR/Cas. The diverse group of species we used included four distinct Chlorella spp. and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. These species display a broad range of growth conditions and metabolic profiles. With the creation of standardised tools for the stable engineering of microalgae, the community will be able to continue asking deeper questions about basic biology and, drastically increase the promise of microalgae as industrial hosts.	kharma	Nawwaf Kharma	None	None	wiltshir;alexjcampbell1;nlauren;shohammookerjee;mwhiteway	Zach Wiltshire;Alex Campbell;Lauren Narcross;Shoham Mookerjee;Malcolm Whiteway	None	None	DilanJ;victor14;Nicole.Cappadocia;elenaboueiri;d81024;VHS;Baksz;Melissa~;Lisawalks;Hayfaing;amitmalhotra;steveb;hessamkr	Dilan Jaunky;victor yuan;Nicole Cappadocia-Assaly;elena Boueiri;Dave Oram;Valerie Hayot-Sasson;Marta Bakinowska;Melissa Gurnagul;Lisa Walker;Hayfa AKOUBI;Amit Malhotra;Steven Bouganim;Hessam K.

Pollutants including lead, mercury, and nickel can enter water supplies through improper disposal of waste, industrial manufacturing, and mining.  Previous researchers have developed biological methods of heavy metal sequestration utilizing heavy metal transport proteins and metallothioneins, a class of low-molecular weight proteins with high binding affinities for heavy metals.  In these genetically engineered systems, the transport proteins will preferentially transport a specific heavy metal into the cell and the metallothionein will aggressively bind--driving flux into the cell and sequestering the toxic metal.  Our research aims to modularize previous sequestration systems for nickel and mercury utilizing a yeast metallothionein/glutathione-s-transferase fusion protein as well the transport proteins NixA (nickel transporter) and merT/merP (mercury transporter).  We also plan to extend this sequestration system using a putative lead transport protein.	xs66	Xiling Shen	None	None	None	None	None	None	E.Holmes;S.Sureka;A.Chakravorty;C.Soong;J.Ly;J.Chen;K.Wheeler;M.Sennett;N.Bhatt;O.Spassibojko;P.Sharma;R.Chew;R.Sarkar;R.Ashley;S.Gregg;S.Dong;T.Abbott;T.Su;G.Livermore;J.Fridman;M.Li;A.Han;A.Gittelman;C.Zhang;G.Ratnaparkhi;G.Danias;K.Hui;M.Zhang;N.Patel;N.Chitrao;R.Singh;S.Hoque	Eric Holmes;Swati Sureka;Arun Chakravorty;Christine Soong;Jeffrey Ly;Jonlin Chen;Kyle Wheeler;Mac Sennett;Nupur Bhatt;Olya Spassibojko;Prashant Sharma;Rebecca Chew;Ritvik Sarkar;Ryan Ashley;Sara Gregg;Sharlene Dong;Timothy Abbott;Tina Su;Grace Livermore;Joseph Fridman;Minghao Li;Alex Han;Aaron Gittelman;Casey Zhang;Gargi Ratnaparkhi;George Danias;Kevin Hui;Michelle Zhang;Neema Patel;Neil Chitrao;Rishabh Singh;Samah Hoque	None	None	BBa_K1460000	BBa_K1460999

In order to address the growing threat of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, new antibacterial agents are required. We have engineered a novel phage therapy utilizing the endogenous CRISPR-Cas9 system from Streptococcus pyogenes packaged into non-replicating phage.  CRISPR-Cas9 systems target 20-32 nucleotide DNA sequences within the bacterial genome. Successful CRISPR targeting to the genome leads to a Cas9-mediated DNA double strand break and subsequent cell death. By cloning targeted CRISPR sequences into the endogenous CRISPR-Cas9 system and introducing this system into Escherichia coli by transformation or through phage infection, we have demonstrated sequence specific killing of bacteria in a heterogeneous bacterial population. The broad ranging applications of such an adaptable and cost effective antibiotic therapy range from healthcare to agriculture and represent the future of antibacterial research.	rdowell	Robin Dowell	None	None	None	None	None	None	SZimmermann;kendra;Leighla;johe2273;AlexMartinez;leesahh;kraftdo;joiv5471;Justine93;daga3152;anma3636;jimmynovik;ryadav;Yaqi	Sarah Zimmermann;Kendra Shattuck;Leighla Tayefeh;Josephina Hendrix;Alexander Martinez;Julissa Duran-Malle;Daren Kraft;Joshua Ivie;Justine Wagner;Daniel Garey;Andrea Mariani;Kirill Novik;Rishabh Yadav;Yang Qiao	mdbrasino;timjread;saoh6797;stemmwolf;pogoda	Michael Brasino;Tim Read;Samantha O'Hara;Alexander Stemm-Wolf;Cloe Pogoda	BBa_K1445000	BBa_K1445999

However, the function or robustness of many circuits relies on ultrasensitive, switch-like responses from the transcription factors involved. Currently, CRISPR-based tools have distinctively analog, non-Boolean responses, making them unsuitable for use in functions that require a steep response curve. Tools that introduce Boolean-like ultra-sensitivity into the CRISPR system would increase its versatility for applications in complex gene circuits.
