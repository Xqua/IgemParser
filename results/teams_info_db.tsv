879	Alberta	University of Alberta  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada  www.ualberta.ca	None	Collegiate	iGEM	North America	CANADA	Unspecified	iGEM 2012 Americas West	 Foundational Advance	Towards a microbial color wheel: spatial control of gene expression	As a young team composed of high schoolers and junior undergraduates, we selected a project aimed at giving ourselves a firm understanding in the fundamentals of genetic engineering and control. The end goal of our project was to create spatial color patterns using bacteria, such as a color wheel and a rainbow, that required control over several color outputs in response to spatial gradients of chemical inducers. Colour gradients were achieved using a high-copy plasmid that contained both an inducible colour gene and its corresponding repressor. Colour banding was achieved by a novel means of adjusting gene expression through plasmid copy number control that varied from 0 to ~1000 copies/cell as a function of inducer concentration. Note that the rapid loss of plasmid that occurs in the absence of inducer also constitutes a novel and extremely effective safety switch for genetically engineered organisms which might enter the environment.	dridgway	Douglas Ridgway	None	None	ellison	Mike Ellison	None	None	tepatric;rsshort;echidamb;rick24568509;p.west;tlemire;A.burke;abdullah.farooq;SarahHaeubl	Thomas Patrick;Robert Spencer Short;Easwaramurthyvasi Chidambaravasi;Nien-Tsu Tseng;Peter West;Torrin Lemire;Aidan Burke;Abdullah Farooq;Sarah Haeubl	None	None	BBa_K879000	BBa_K879999

Current technologies for detection of bacteria include DNA hybridization FRET signaling, electrical detection via immobilized antimicrobial peptides, and PCR amplification followed by gel visualization. Our method of bacterial detection fills a niche in biosensor technology. Our design implies lower costs, higher portability, and a more rapid signal output than most bacterial biosensors. Additionally, our interchangeable DNA probe confers modularity, allowing for a range of bacterial detection. Using a split beta-galactosidase complementation assay, we have designed three unique chimeric proteins that recognize and bind to specific pathogenic markers and create a functioning beta-galactosidase enzyme. This functioning enzyme unit then cleaves x-gal and produces a colorimetric output signal. Our research demonstrates success in initial stages of chimeric protein assembly.	kahaynes	Karmella Haynes	None	None	xiaowang;fluffy1	Xiao Wang;Vincent Pizziconi	None	None	ethan_ward;Rohit_Rajan;abhinavmarkus;Hyder;rmuller1;napatel;eqin;aispas;mhsands	Ethan Ward;Rohit Rajan;Abhinav Markus;Khateeb H.

Nowadays, 1.5 million tons/year from human activity which is used in the world is PET. PET is a thermoplastic polymer resin, not easily degraded naturally. Based on this background, the BAU-Indonesia team designs a plasmid which is contains of encoding cutinase degrading enzymes of producing PET. The early stage of this project was done by the preservation of plastic waste bacteria from landfills at Galuga. The bacteria were cultured in liquid media which is contained yeast extract powder and PET enrichment. The result of this preservation will be followed by the isolation of DNA and PCR with Cutinase F primer'ACGCGCCGGGCGTCACCGAGCA'3 and R 5'ACGCGTCGTGCCGTCAGGGCCA'3. Cutinase gen that were amplified will be inserted to plasmid pSB1C3. The recombinant plasmid which contained the cutinase gene will be introduced into E. coli. Finally it will be used as PET biodegradator product.	ach.farajallah	Achmad Farajallah	None	None	None	None	None	None	mfadhillah;Masrukhin;arinugroho;unis09;hendris09;aditrianr;muhamadabduh;restipratiwi;ayun;m.rizkifaisal	Mohammad Fadhillah;Masrukhin;Ari Nugroho;Uni Sutiah;Hendri Sutanto;Aditrian Rahim;muhamad abduh;Resti Pratiwi;kurrata ayun;M.

At present, engineering these properties is challenging due in large part to the inherent throughput limitation imposed by microscopy. We have developed a strategy that enables high-throughput library screening with microscopy by coupling a unique fluorescence signature with each genotype present in a library. These MiCodes (microscopy barcodes) are generated by targeting combinations of fluorophores to several organelles within yeast, and they eliminate the need to isolate and observe clonal populations separately. MiCodes can potentially scale to library sizes of 10^6 or more, and their analysis can be largely automated using existing image processing software. As a proof of principle, we applied MiCodes to the problem of finding unique pairs of protein-protein interaction parts.	jdueber	John Dueber	None	None	wideloache;tdj	Will DeLoache;Terry D.

Especially the use of synthetic estrogen in birth control pills results in increasing the concentrations of this disruptor in wastewater. Therefore, ""iGEM Team Bielefeld"" is developing a biological filter using immobilized laccases, enzymes able to radicalize and break down a broad range of aromatic substances. For the production of laccases from different bacteria, fungi and plants, two expression systems are used: ""Escherichia coli"" and the yeast ""Pichia pastoris"". Immobilization is carried out either by using cpc-silica beads or by fusing the enzymes to cellulose binding domains.

Fusion protein design has always been time- and design-intensive, to say the least. We are developing and characterizing a fusion construct containing a light sensitive domain, providing easy coupling and light activation of proteins of interest to investigators, thus developing a protein-level light-induced knockout.      Using the LOV (Light, Oxygen, Voltage) domain commonly found in plants, where it enables light-directed growth, we are establishing guidelines for coupling proteins of interest to the LOV domain, which allows control of protein activity through blue wavelength light. Designing our reversible knockout at the protein level allows quick response times (2.2 microseconds activation time, 85 seconds deactivation time).     A device of that kind could be of great importance as a tool for disinfection on a laboratory  scale or mutant selection via blue light. Further potential applications of our LOV fusion  system include bioreactor regulation or site-specific drug activation.	gue.mayer	Günter Mayer	None	None	mfamulok	Michael Famulok	None	None	NLudwig;MaxSch;KatharinaD;maklum;RebeccaH;psander;er_st;CMartens;KevBa;TaFu;JohnNguyen	Nicolas Ludwig;Max Schelski;Katharina Düker;Matthias Klumpp;Rebecca Halbach;Philipp N.

Our main goal is to engineer a single strain of bacteria able produce concentric patterns on the dishes. The challenge is to model a regulatory mechanism which mimics both cell differentiation and cell-to-cell communication observed in eukaryotes.  We chose to create four operons (a total of 21 assemblies): three to allow the communication and expression of a visible phenotype, the fourth  containing the genes needed for signal transduction. Each of the three first operons will respond to a specific quorum-sensing system (QSS) and trigger another QSS resulting in a chain reaction communicating a unique signal to all bacteria nearby.  We also developed our model in silico to run simulation and test parameters that influence pattern propagation on a petri dish.

We built a vast number of both simple and complex genetic circuits that were characterized using flow cytometry. These genetic circuits were built using an assembly technique called MoClo (developed by Weber et al., 2011), which involves a multi-way, one-pot digestion-ligation reaction, enabling faster and more efficient construction of genetic circuits. We converted a large subset of BioBrick™ Parts from the Registry (http://partsregistry.org/) into MoClo Parts using PCR and cloning strategies. We built and characterized various genetic circuits using MoClo Parts and compared them against their pre-existing BioBrick™ counterparts in order to compare the characterization results from the two assembly techniques. We also created a standardized data sheet to be included in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts for each Part we characterized to easily share our data with the synthetic biology community.	densmore	Douglas Densmore	None	None	THaddock	Traci H.

In contrast to this current paradigm, microbes have naturally evolved to survive as members of dynamic communities with distributed metabolism. This “divide and conquer” strategy allows the community to perform more complicated metabolic processing than would be possible in single microorganisms while being resilient to environmental changes. Despite very recent proof of concepts in developing model microbial consortia, or synthetic ecology, questions remain as to whether complex metabolic pathways can be engineered in context of microbial populations. The 2012 University of British Columbia iGEM team sets a precedent by engineering a tunable consortium with a distributed 4S desulfurization pathway for increased efficiency in the removal of organosulfurs in heavy oils and bitumen resources.	joannealisonfox	Joanne Fox	None	None	shallam	Steven Hallam	None	None	Ruichen;tingchiawong;minjup;joeho604;jacobtoth;grace.yi;mehuls;Cam;JohnHenry	Ruichen Xue;Ting-Chia Wong;Marianne (Minju) Park;Joe Ho;Jacob Toth;Grace Yi;Mehul Sharma;Cameron Strachan;John Henry Deppe	Ayjchan;mvanins;rsaer;jwround	Alina Chan;Michael VanInsberghe;Rafael saer;James W Round	BBa_K804000	BBa_K804999

Our system would allow the co-culture of several genetically engineered machines in tunable proportions. Hence the engineered organism would be a standard part! This defines a new level of modularity allowing the increase of the complexity of the system by moving to the community level.  We´ve come up with several plausible circuits designs and in silico predictions and decided to build a “crossfeeding” system in which each strain produces and secretes an aminoacid the other strains need to grow.  We characterized two auxotrophic yeast strains (for tryptophan and histidine) and designed novel biobricks that regulate the export of Trp and His rich peptides.   In the future this would allow for other modules to control the proportions of each strain, thus allowing dynamic and stimulus dependent changes in the abundances of each strain.	anadra	Alejandro Nadra	None	None	nachoquique	Ignacio E.

Last year, the BYU iGEM team genetically engineered E. coli to detect heat or ROS. This year we developed E. coli capable of simultaneously sensing lactate, heat and ROS, implemented a novel Cre-Lox system, and constructed a library of thermosensors.  Our project uses two circuits, each with a unique reporter.  The first circuit contains a RNA thermosensor driven by a ROS-inducible promoter, allowing expression of Cre recombinase when both heat and ROS are present.  Although heat is transient, Cre ensures continued expression of the first reporter gene.  The second circuit contains a periplasmic lactate sensor coupled to a second reporter.  Finally, we have evolved a library of thermosensors that work in a narrow physiological range.  Together, this two-circuit system may allow accurate and specific detection of early colon cancer cells.	jgrose	Julianne Grose	None	None	warnick	Sean Warnick	None	None	justinmeek;johnwshumway;reesj;ewilliamjones;MNSOD;buckleya;joeand;ksbollenbach;broark2;rossjack1;raf59;HilllaryEmery;Kimokun;JKitch;Yuro;jordantm;JosephThiriot	Justin Meek;John W.

This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.	jh295	Jim Haseloff	None	None	GMicklem	Gos Micklem	None	None	ap650;olijme;Jolyon.M;blipflip;CharlotteBG;scb67;emmyft;pdmallaband	Andreas Petrides;Oliver Meacock;Jolyon Martin;Thomas Whittaker;Charlotte Bransfield Garth;Stuart Bell;Fai Tsang;Paul Mallaband	None	None	BBa_K911000	BBa_K911999

However, quantitative information about the expression strength of a synthetic promoter has been difficult to obtain due to the lack of noninvasive and real-time approaches to measure the levels of both RNA and protein in cells. Here, we engineer a fluorogen-activated bio-sensor that can provide information on both transcription strength and translation efficiency. This biosensor is noninvasive, easily applied to a variety of promoters, and more efficient than existing technologies. To demonstrate the utility of our biosensor, we constructed and characterized several designed T7Lac hybrid promoters. Furthermore, we developed a mathematical model of our synthetic system to guide experiments and an open-source electronic kit that mimics experimental setup and well suited for education purposes. Our results could have a broad impact on the measurement and standardization of synthetic biological parts.	leocmt	Cheemeng Tan	None	None	natasa_mz	Natasa Miskov-Zivanov	None	None	enpederson;JSalazar88;PeterJWei;ychoo	Eric Pederson;Jesse Salazar;Peter Wei;Yang Choo	geyangcmu;dianam;Catalina;aaronmitchell	Ge Yang;Diana Marculescu;Catalina Achim;Aaron Mitchell	BBa_K921000	BBa_K921999

The first tool, MG-designer, is functionally divided into designer and viewer.   The viewer shows the information of genomes in both linear and circular form. So it is easier for users to understand the characteristic of genomes. By the designer, user can design minimal genomes by essential genes which are analogized by our team in this year. The minimal genome can be designed depending on characteristics of species by inserting the function of genes into particular locations.    With the second tool, brick-designer, user can design new bio-bricks.  It is also able to synthesize bricks by using the bricks registered in partsregistry. User can also utilize bricks he just designed. We tried to enhance software potability by enabling the bricks to save as Genbank and SBOL types. Brick also can be saved as picture file so that it is helpful in the Wiki implementation.	csrhee	Chung Sei Rhee	None	None	youngkim;dchung	Young-Chang Kim;Daehyun Chung	None	None	achievstar;WoodJs;hhj;jshsemo;byeonggonlee;Joddong89;kimjeaho;crireta;nalssniy;naoope;Jangwy8838;wannn;kim09064;galaxy16	Sehi LY'i;Ju Sang Ha;Hwi Ju Hong;Sehee Jeong;Byeong Gon Lee;Dong-Hyun Jo;JeaHo Kim;Yun-Gyun Ahn;Hyein Lee;Byeonggon Ji;WOO-YEONG, JANG;chang wan kim;YounJoo Kim;Sohee Park	None	None	BBa_K860000	BBa_K860999

This reaction is done almost instantly and it is used as a signal by distinct organisms like E.coli, C.albicans associated in the regulation of emergency signaling. Also, an association of the H+/HCO3- ratio and the signaling pathway of adenilate cyclase has been seen. The employment of these genes with reporter proteins can be used to indirectly calculate the concentration of environmental CO2.  The CO2 concentration depends on the partial pressure and the speed with it is assimilated by the liquid. The fastest it gets to the saturation point 5%, the higher is the CO2 concentration.	pablo	Pablo Padilla	None	None	msfunes	Soledad Funes	None	None	larsmx;fercea;gordeiros;ileana;cjdg;Jesús;LUIS DE JESUS;JOSE	Mario Sánchez Domínguez;Fernando Cea Olvera;Ricardo Munguía Díaz;Ileana de la Fuente Colmenares;Cristian Delgado;Jesús Pérez Juárez;LUIS DE JESUS MARTINEZ LOMELI;JOSE MARTINEZ LOMELI	None	None	BBa_K872000	BBa_K872999

Taking advantage of this, our project aims to build two genetic control systems based on R. sphaeroides photosynthesis cluster regulation. The first one is a light dependent system controlled by two proteins AppA/PpsR that works like an antirepresor/repressor mechanism, and the second one is an oxygen dependent system of two-component called PrrA/PrrB. This two devices were tested on R. palustris chassis, using a cassete in which a reporter (GFP) is regulated by external conditions that activate or repress its expresion. Once we have characterized the functionality of these networks, our perspective is to develop a Rhodofactory, it means to control the produccion of differents metabolites, such as biodiesel and butanol, using simple signals.	bioingenios	Agustino Martinez-Antonio	None	None	Rhodosuaste;pbzars;Nuria;JorgeM	Fernando Suaste Olmos;Paola Berenice Zárate Segura;Nuria Sanchez-Puig;Jorge Morales Montor	None	None	DnielDgz;ao.patricia;LoboLofi;Jhonatan;Maritere;Liss;KarenHega	Daniel Domínguez Gómez;Patricia Elizabeth Arias Orozco;Iván López Flores;Jhonatan Alejandro Hernandez-Valdes;Maritere Uriostegui-Arcos;Lissania Ximena Guerra-Calderas;Karen Hernandez Gallardo	UruguayanMayan;Fer;KarenNava	Daniel Federico Hernandez Gardiol;Fernando G.

There are over 200 possible PCBs, derivatives of biphenyl, which share the same biodegradation pathways in bacteria. Our team is using a genetic engineering approach to produce a small consortium of E. coli that should efficiently degrade biphenyl, and it is hoped that this same system can be adapted for the bioremediation of PCBs. Natural bioremediation by native bacterial communities is exceedingly slow due to the recalcitrant nature of PCBs and their hydrophobic properties which reduce the bioavailability to potential catabolizers. We are taking a three-pronged approach in an attempt to increase the efficiency of biphenyl bioremediation—attraction of biphenyl-degrading E. coli by other guiding bacteria, overexpression of the biphenyl catabolic enzymes, and production of a biosurfactant to increase the solubility of biphenyl. Together, this system should significantly increase the rate of biphenyl degradation.	tzuenrt	Tzuen-Rong Jeremy Tzeng	None	None	mcao	Min Cao	None	None	andreealuvv;ascanla@clemson.edu;rkane;KellyTM;mbickfo;wtsmith;rlouie;awhatle;wcrain	Andreea Nicolaica;Aaron Scanlan;Ryan Kane;Kelly Merchant;Matthew Bickford;William Smith;Rachel Louie;Ariel Whatley;Whitney Crain	abrown	Aaron Brown	BBa_K803000	BBa_K803999

Knowing full well the problems caused by Celiac disease, and the affinity many others have for reducing gluten in their diets, we decided to design and create a yeast strain capable of both fermenting quality beer, and breaking down gluten. Our search for an enzyme capable of breaking down gluten and neutralizing its toxicity led us to the enzyme mutated by the 2011 UW IGEM team. The modified Kumamolisin-As has a maximal activity at a pH of 4 and would work well in the pH range of 5.2-5.5 found in beer. For expression in yeast we had to account for codon bias, and optimized the sequence so it could more easily be moved from a prokaryotic system to a eukaryotic one.

The cassette contains the luciferase enzyme and enzymes necessary for regeneration of its substrates.  The final goal is to make cyanobacteria (Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7002) glow because cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis and therefore do not need supplied nutrients. First, the experiment is carried out in E. coli and afterwards the plasmid is transferred to the cyanobacteria. Both of the systems will subsequently be thoroughly analyzed to determine important characteristics of the system including kinetics and efficiency of the expression levels.

To overcome this obstacle, the Cornell iGEM team has developed a new generation of biosensors capable of a direct current output which can be recorded easily with high precision. By upregulating the metal-reduction pathway of  Shewanella oneidensis in the presence of a target compound, these sensors can act as a continuos monitoring system.

To detect hazardous levels of sun radiation our system is based on UVR-8, a UV sensing protein from plants.   In its dark state, this protein forms a homodimer that dissociates upon UV radiation.    We fused UVR-8 with the DNA binding domain from TetR, which is unable to dimerize and to bind DNA in monomeric form. UV-exposure might force the TetR-UVR8 fusion dimer to split, release the DNA and enable transcription. Thus, TetR-UVR8 might act as a light-activated on-switch in bacteria.    We plan to use this novel switch to start the production of para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA), a common ingredient of sunscreen, and - dependent on the intensity and duration of exposure as determined by our detailed in silico model - a colored pigment as a visible warning signal.	sven	Sven Panke	None	None	joergs;langmo;MarkusJ;JohannesH	Joerg Stelling;Moritz Lang;Markus Jeschek;Johannes Haerle	None	None	Tim.Enke;Isi;stefang;lisase;huberdeb;dseifert;Gintas;skundert	Tim Enke;Isaak Mueller;Stefan Ganscha;Lisa Seyfarth;Deborah Huber;David Seifert;Gintautas Vainorius;Sandro Kundert	None	None	BBa_K909000	BBa_K909999

This leap towards multicellular biological engineering required new tools, so we first developed a new set of frog compatible vectors, biobricked tissue specific promoters and a new technique to assemble them in a single shot. To benefit from tissue compartmentalisation, we created a synthetic, orthogonal hormonal system using the plant molecule auxin. We also investigated E. coli/Xenopus interfacing, effectively creating a synthetic ecosystem. We modelled our system at the organism scale, using a multi-level and multi-technique approach. Finally, working with whole animals during iGEM brought a load of difficult ethical questions regarding animal biotechnologies and experimentation. This led us to wonder: Are we a chassis?

These properties stem from the relationships between the chemical nature of the sugars, their arrangement within the polymer and the arrangement of the polymer itself. Scientists rely on chemical modification of polysaccharides or expensive and time-consuming production via synthetic chemistry to understand these relationships.    This project, e-candi, asks if synthetic biology could generate designer polysaccharides.    We created biobricks for the biosynthesis of useful polysaccharides in Escherichia coli and asked whether we could synthesise a novel polymer sequence in E. coli by targeting endogenous polysaccharide biosynthesis.    We developed this work further through the generation of a GTase database with a user-friendly interface to aid polymer construction, and by investigating a GTase donor/acceptor characterization assay alongside mathematical modeling of our biosynthetic system in order to improve system understanding and performance.	tphoward	Thomas Howard	None	None	geolittlejohn;mtp206;penamiller;csambles	George Littlejohn;Mike Page;Rafael Pena-Miller;Christine Sambles	None	None	agb207;Stubby;On7h33dg3;mebexe;andycorbett;bond4000;Freddie;Lex;jamesml213;beccaphilp;Chris323	Alex Baldwin;Liam Stubbington;Ryan Edginton;Mary E.

Transactivator-Like Effectors (TALEs) are a brand-new technology that currently revolutionizes the way researchers manipulate DNA with exceptional site specificity. Originally derived from Xanthomonas spp., this type of protein comprizes an effector domain and a modular DNA binding domain that can be rationally designed to bind to virtually any target sequence of DNA. Over the past two years, universal endonucleases (TALENs) and transcription factors have been tested in various organisms ranging from bacteria to humans.  According to existing protocols, TALE assembly requires several weeks of work and substantial lab skills. In order to bring this technology within reach for iGEM students, we invented an extremely fast and easy TALE assembly strategy and developed a TALE platform with expression plasmids and new classes of TALEs.  With our so called GATE assembly kit, future iGEM students will be able to precisely manipulate genomic loci easier and faster than anyone else in the world.

The time switch we made counts the replication number of a single yeast cell, and triggers the activation of a certain gene (death gene, for example) when the replication number of the cell reaches the pre-set level. The work is an attempt to use the special quality of telomere and the end of chromosomes in the construction of synthetic biology device. Our system utilizes a whole new mechanism that is seldom used in cell counting device, and it enables us to delay the expression of a certain gene for generations. By control the life span of a certain cell, it sheds new light on the biosafety concerns and can be used for fields such as the protection of intellectual property rights.	xmding74	Xiaoming Ding	None	None	Ruoyu	Ruoyu Luo	None	None	jewel;Chocolatenw;DH_Chao;18dubu;Charmander;duoduo;Beta;WillWay;clover;eugenezhao;Christine;freechaser;caojie;otismage;Rangdonggua;Tarovey;Verve;lzmin;fengshui;Quta_qbbiotheo;Yilai;icyliu;firzen;NGNX;Arthurvon	Xiaoting Zhu;Wei Ning;Chao Zhang;Handong Ma;Hankun Li;Duo Xu;Taijie Jin;Wei Wei;Zhihao Guo;Xiang Zhao;Kangyun Dong;Yan-Cheng Chao;Jie Cao;Wentao Chen;Dan Chen;Zhongcheng Wang;Li Yu;Zengmin Li;zhengxi wu;Haotian Q.

The detection module consists of a recombinant membrane receptor that, once activated, actuates an amplification loop. The amplification system contains a genetic feed forward loop, which filters out false positive outputs. Once amplified and filtered, the signal is transmitted to neighboring bacteria via a diffusible molecule. In turn, the amplification loop is triggered which leads to the production of a measurable fluorescence output. The design of our network is easily adaptable to different input signals by using other receptor domains.	hans_geiselmann	Johannes Geiselmann	None	None	ropers;weidenhm;dejong	Delphine Ropers;marianne weidenhaupt;hidde de jong	None	None	clemenni;nadia_gre;adeline_millet;JulieH;Pierregrenoble;LINKS;Mathieu;greghansen;Eliseb	Nicolas CLÉMENT;Nadia Ben Dahmane;Adeline Millet;Julie Herrbach;Pierre Pautré;Jérôme LINKS;Mathieu Simonin;Grégory Hansen;Elise Berlinski	JeanBaptiste;BouGeo7314;PINHAL_Stephane;Valentin	Jean-Baptiste Lugagne;BOUCHAGE Geoffrey;PINHAL Stephane;Valentin Zulkower	BBa_K845000	BBa_K845999

The ability to make many orthogonal buffer amps is critical to scaling up digital information processing in vivo. For our project, we first provide two mathematical proofs: (1) the buffer amp is ""equivalent"" to a bistable circuit, in that the ability to create one implies the ability to create the other, and (2) inhibitors with first-order binding cannot allow bistability (without other elements). This means that methods such as TALORs and many sRNA strategies cannot build a buffer amp. Thus, we test a new method: sequence-specific formation of a DNA-DNA-RNA triple helix to block a promoter. By using a dimer for the RNA, we can achieve second-order binding, allowing us to build sequence-specific buffer amps."	drewell	Robert Drewell	None	None	None	None	None	None	jwentworth;szhang;mangorune;byeh;LWinkler;ablee	John Wentworth;Sherry Zhang;Benjamin Johnson;Beverly Yeh;Lauren Winkler;Bo Lee	None	None	BBa_K789000	BBa_K789999

PvdQ, an enzyme naturally produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is an acylase that functions to degrade long chain AHLs that bacteria like Pseudomonas putida or aeruginosa itself utilize for biofilm formation. Biofilms are population density-dependent structures formed by quorum sensing bacteria that produce and secrete auto-inducers, which signal selective gene transcription. These signaling molecules, namely the AHLs, are responsible for most bacterial pathogenicity including the opportunistic respiratory infections caused by P.aeuroginosa in immunocompromised patients.	jdhuang	Jiandong Huang	None	None	juliantanner;rmwatt	Julian A.

We exploited the use of halobacterial sensors, the sensory rhodopsins which are sensitive to a wide spectrum of readily available light source and build a series of sensing systems to control cellular movement and gene regulation. This system can be executed as a fundamental part for further applications, such as cell targeting and refining. Furthermore, to counter the safety issues caused by the leakage of bioengineered cells, this sensing method altogether with the CRISPR/Cas sytem can targart and achieve the cleavage of the transformed plasmid under the stimulation of natural light sources.

Bacteria have an efflux operon regulated by an arsenic sensitive inducible promoter.  It is possible through recombinant DNA technology to isolate this promoter and combine it to a reporter system and transform bacteria to create a biosensor for arsenic. Induction of the arsenic-sensitive promoter occurs by the binding of arsenite to an inhibitory protein, de-repressing transcription.  We have observed the arsenic responsive promoter from E. coli to have a consistent, low level of background induction.  We have tested the hypothesis that by increasing the quantity of the inhibitory protein in the cell, we can quantifiably raise the threshold of the response.  Our intention is to create a tunable biosensor to form the basis of a low-tech device that can reliably detect dangerous levels of arsenic in water for use in the developing world.	geotwaddle	George Twaddle	None	None	None	None	None	None	mikalski;ado;ahakaj;nan0t3k;rgeldner;Heather37;ahaines4;Jennparra;bigmomma;ChanceTheChase	christopher moseti;Alice Do;Andrea Hakaj;Floyd J.

Thanks to synthetic biology applications exploiting the yeast chassis, valuable compounds such as anti-malarial drugs and specialty chemicals can now be produced inexpensively. Using Golden Gate assembly designed for BioBrick compatibility, we have developed two tools to improve yeast expression of non-native pathways. First, we engineered an ethanol control system that reduces yeast's endogenous stress response and diverts more cellular resources towards product synthesis. Second, we constructed a light-induced system for instantaneous gain- and loss-of-function at the protein level. These tools will allow engineers to optimize heterologous pathways by monitoring toxic intermediates or regulating flux in a controllable, time-dependent manner.

Rice, which is the staple diet of India and many other countries around the world, is believed to engender many potential greenhouse gases or global warming gases per se like carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide, is released due to the inevitable use of nitrogen fertilizers which are added in the paddy fields. We are dealing with the conversion of nitrous oxide into nitrate form using synthetic biology tools to insert two genes into a bacterial cassette along with its detection systems. This nitrate, can be utilized by the plant itself, solving our purpose and adding a new dimension to this diversion and in turn being beneficial for the farmers reducing the compromise factor that would, otherwise, have been done.

852	Leicester	University of Leicester	None	Collegiate	iGEM	Europe	UNITED KINGDOM	Unspecified	iGEM 2012 Europe	 Food	A Synthetic Biology Solution To Polystyrene Degradation.	Objective - Naturally occurring organisms using polystyrene as their sole source of carbon have been recently identified, by analysing the occurrence of polystyrene breakdown products. However these metabolites accumulate very slowly, explaining why polystyrene is so persistent in the environment. Polystyrene can currently be recycled, but due to the low density of the majority of polystyrene products it is economically unfavourable, due to the high energy demands. If inexpensive biological degradation can be achieved this would assist recycling, but we also hope to use products of this reaction to make useful organic chemicals.     Aim - To construct BioBricks from the genes encoding enzymes involved in this pathway and manipulate their expression and properties to maximise the rate of polystyrene degradation.     Hypothesis - genes encoding the enzymes of the polystyrene breakdown pathway can be isolated and expressed in a host microorganism and the rate of the process increased by genetic manipulation.	badgerichard	Richard Badge	None	None	leicray	Raymond Dalgleish	None	None	AnthonyCox;Chris_r_morton;njdh1;lt114;Phiggs;willman92;ladybird136;Reema;iddu8	Anthony I.

Microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) has been utilized across the world to increase the productivity of these difficult resources. Using a synthetic biology approach, we have designed the CAB (CO2, acetic acid, biosurfactant) extraction method for a modified MEOR to extract carbonate oil deposits. CAB extraction will utilize natural carbon fixation machinery in the cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus to convert CO2 into sugars to fuel acetic acid and biosurfactant production in Escherichia coli. Acetic acid and biosurfactant applied to carbonate rock will facilitate and enhance extraction. The use of carbon fixation to feed downstream systems can be tailored for many applications requiring inexpensive methods for fueling biological systems, while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions. CAB extraction provides an alternative, inexpensive, and environmentally sustainable MEOR method for carbonate oil deposits.

"Biofilms are responsible for billions of dollars in production losses and treatment costs in the industry every year. Biofilm-related problems are major concerns in the food industry where it can cause food spoilage or poisoning, in health industry because of pathogens' persistence and dispersal, or in the oil and water industry where it causes corrosion. Assuming that the environment is already over-saturated with harmful chemicals such as biocides, whose long term health effects remains to be elucidated, there is a great need for innovating solutions to reduce detrimental biofilm effects.    To reduce the use of biocides, the INSA-Lyon iGEM team aims to engineer a bacterial ""torpedo"" capable to infiltrate and destroy biofilms formed on industrial equipments, pipes or reservoirs. Industrial surfaces will then be protected from further deleterious contamination by either a surfactant coating, or the establishment of a protective biofilm produced by the torpedo bacteria."	cdorelflamant	Corinne Dorel-Flamant	None	None	ylouis;Agnès;DesjardinV;obrette;poger	Yoann LOUIS;Agnès Rodrigue;Valérie Desjardin;Olivier BRETTE;Phil Oger	None	None	Clémence;mwolfovski;alex273;BastienDoix;carine;patricia.gifu;pishki;@nne;Suxiaohui;AudreyM;almiwe;MarionT;xavier69;beryl;Veldryn	Clémence GONTHIER;Marion Wolfovski;Alexandre Duprey;Bastien DOIX;carine gimbert;Patricia Gifu;Sandu Ioana;Anne Haziza;Viviane Chansavang;Audrey Masi;Alex Mizgier;Marion Traouan;xavier tholot;royer-bertrand beryl;Rémi Hocq	SPRINGER_Fanny;Chambi;Philou;briandet	Fanny SPRINGER;Gaël Chambonnier;Philippe Thomas;Romain Briandet	BBa_K802000	BBa_K802999

This project creates a light-dependent biological switch using the bacteriophytochromes from Deinococcus radiodurans and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. When coupled with heme oxygenase, these bacteriophytochromes are supplied with biliverdin, a pigment which allows for the self-assembly of a switch within the host system. In the presence of red light, the conformation of the bacteriophytochrome is modified. This reaction produces a visible colour change in the presence of red light, and can be used to control expression of a targeted gene when coupled with the appropriate response regulator. Exposure to far-red light will cause the bacteriophytochrome to revert to its original conformation, thus repressing the gene and reversing the colour change.	npacker	Nicki Packer	None	None	rwillows;lbrown	Robert Willows;Louise Brown	None	None	ryankenny;MStClair;Ellaina;andrewdiehm;ehoyer;41503163;Silas;JackB;LauraJ22;HSpedding;elleworgan;sarah.grixti;DanWinter;rob286;Mikken;Kimberlii;41484177	Ryan Kenny;Matthew StClair;Ellaina Andersson;Andrew Diehm;Erin Hoyer;Matthew Simon Smith;Silas Vick;Jack Brandy;Laura Jeffery;Harold Spedding;Ellen Worgan;Sarah Grixti;Daniel Winter;Robert McGraw;Miguel Sanjurjo;Kimberley Duncan;Gazelle Pashan	eddymoh;dr.biohacker;BlueDave;Red_Dave;Jo	Edward Moh;Yagiz Alp Aksoy;David Dubow;David Handler;Joanna Hare	BBa_K953000	BBa_K953999

This diversity is generated by random VDJ-recombination of a limited number of antibody subfragments. This inspired us to construct an automatic recombination system in E. coli that generates large numbers of novel proteins by combinatorial fusion of functional domains.    The site-specific DNA recombinase Gin of bacteriophage Mu depends on the presence of a DNA enhancer element for efficient recombination. This allowed us to construct a system, called “The Recombinator”, which automatically shuts down after successful recombination. We visualized the randomizing function of our genetically engineered slot machine by combining colors with cellular localization domains.    By scaling up the number of recombination modules and functional domains our system will be able to generate a multitude of new proteins. We envision that “The Recombinator” will serve as a tool to create novel enzymatic activities for innovative drug design, environmental detoxification and metabolic engineering.

Further, it is theoretically possible to create complex control circuits using combinations of invertible DNA sequences. We utilized the recombinase HbiF to augment an existing system in Escherichia coli that relied on the recombinase FimE. A burst of induced, low level expression of one recombinase will invert the promoter flanked by the recombinase binding sites, triggering a switch from strong expression of one set of proteins to another set. Induced expression of the second recombinase will revert the promoter to its original orientation, triggering the original set of protein expression. The inversion will be sustained across cell divisions with little leaky protein expression and negligible performance degradation after repeated inversions. This is a heritable, binary memory system and can be used as a component in more complex systems.	mcammer	Marc Ammerlaan	None	None	None	None	None	None	jatk;cbate;albanka;amyjb;ekirk;klminch;uniqenam;namunsri;chowe;Sspangl;MikeFerguson;shanwu;evolver;aventuri;knoxmich;kujasam;htwong;bwpark;hanliny;hanlinyang92	Joshua Atkinson;Christopher Bate;Alison Banka;Amy Bennett;Kirk Elliott;Kaitlyn Minchella;Josh Johnson;Namun Srivastava;Corey Howe;Scott Spangler;Mike Ferguson;Alena Wu;Joshua Abramson;Amy Venturino;Michael Knox;Sam Kujawski;Candy (Hiu-Tung) Wong;Benjamin Parker;Hanlin Yang;Hanlin Yang	jminty;wangke	Jeremy Minty;Ke Wang	BBa_K880000	BBa_K880999

The scaffolding protein can be reduced in size and adapted for the cell surface of Escherichia coli. Different cohesion sites on the new cell surface display protein can also be introduced to allow for attachment of desired enzymes. Future applications would include producing a collection of distinct versions of the scaffolding protein for unique arrangements and concentrations of enzymes, enabling construction of an extra-cellular assembly line for a variety of multi-enzymatic reactions.

However, recent researches revealed that S. typhimurium can survive in other normal tissues, resulting in damage or inflammatory response.    Our project aims to improve the therapeutic property of S. typhimurium by modifying its amino acids-synthesizing genes and screen highly tumor-targeted strains. Then we standardize them to construct a general element used specifically in hypoxic tissues.    The hypoxic feature in the core areas of tumors made it possible for S. typhimurium to target tumors specifically.  Our goal is to screen the anaerobic promoter that can express efficiently in S. typhimurium and ligate it with genes of anti-cancer drugs. The double properties of the strains and promoters enable anti-cancer drugs to express specifically in tumors, fulfilling our goal of decreasing toxic and side effects of the drugs.

While rice can be fortified using vitamin powders, such approaches have had limited success because many vitamins are leeched away during the washing process prior to cooking. To address this problem, we have engineered proteins that will adhere nutrients to rice grains and prevent losses. These proteins contain a starch-binding domain that is fused to specific nutrient-binding domains. Because rice is composed mainly of starch, the starch-binding domain prevents nutrient leeching during washing. Upon cooking, the nutrient-binding domain denatures and releases the nutrients into the cooked rice. Supplementing rice with these fusion proteins will provide a novel, non-GMO approach to fortifying rice. Proteins with a starch-binding domain connected to a vitamin B12-binding domain, a thiamine-binding domain, a lysine-rich protein, and a RFP have been created.	cjhoward	Christie Howard	None	None	Shintani;leochong718	David Shintani;Chong Tang	None	None	jpavelka;jjiang;dordonez;rtruong;cclifford;jemlen;CSarcinella;mngo;verdi91	Jeremiah Pavelka;Simin Jiang;Dafne Ordonez;Ronald Truong;Chris Clifford;Justin Emlen;Cody Alexander Sarcinella;Michelle Ngo;Joseph Alexander	None	None	BBa_K931000	BBa_K931999

Surprisingly, this deficiency is typically not due to a lack of dietary iron, but rather due to low bio-availability, and thus poor absorption of iron. Phytic acid is a prevalent chelator of iron and other nutrients in food. Our mission is to build a system that breaks down phytic acid in the digestive system, releasing bound iron for the body to absorb. Our solution comprises two engineered components: a module that constitutively produces phytase to break down phytic acid and a pH-sensitive module that causes cells to lyse and release the accumulated phytase in the stomach. If successful, our strain would be a low-cost sustainable solution to preventing iron deficiency without the need for constant supplies of iron supplements.

Imagine a world in which all sectors of industry use synthetic biology to meet specific needs. The NRP-UEA team have developed novel biobricks, which provide a foundation for a system with this level of complexity. The project began with a simple idea with widespread applications: the detection of exogenous nitric oxide (NO). However it soon became clear the detection of highly reactive NO was challenging, and this was addressed in two main ways. A bacterial promoter, PyeaR, was fused to its mammalian counterpart, CArG. The functionality of this flexible dual promoter was determined in both mammalian and bacterial chassis. Yet it was determined that further specificity was still needed, leading to the comparator circuit, that subtracts the expression of one promoter from that of another, allowing for signal integration and quantitative computing.  This system thus allows for the detection of any chemical, providing the promoters have overlapping specificity.	rkelwick	Richard Kelwick	None	None	RBowater	Richard Bowater	None	None	khadijaouadi;joyehicks;YuenYeeLo;LukasHarnisch;Pascoe.J.Harvey;gcn10tdu;RussellGritton	Khadija Ouadi;Joy Edwards-Hicks;Rebecca Lo;Lukas Harnisch;Pascoe James Harvey;Rachel Dobson;Russell Gritton	ACongdon	Amy Congdon	BBa_K774000	BBa_K774999

Our approach for solving this problem has been to develop a genetic circuit that makes E.coli cells able to release toxic molecules only when in presence of cancer cells.  As cancer cells grow faster than healthy cells, they also consume more oxygen and release more lactate than a healthy cell would do, so to make the E.coli cells recognize cancer cells we have made a system where the input signals are high lactate concentration and low oxygen concentration. When these criteria are met, the E.coli cells will undergo lysis, and release the toxin colicin, which our cells are producing constitutively.  With our project, we want to show that one of the biggest challenges in medicine can be solved by synthetic biology.	eivnd	Eivind Almaas	None	None	rahmilale;eidsaa;Martin_HM	Rahmi Lale;Marius Eidsaa;Martin Hohmann-Marriott	None	None	Gunvor;oyas;Jarlemag;ninahole;eirinko;rolfheil	Gunvor Røkke;Ove Øyås;Jarle Pahr;Nina Lillebø Hole;Eirin Korvald;Rolf Heilemann Myhre	None	None	BBa_K822000	BBa_K822999

We engineer the non-pathogenic E. coli which senses fatty acids in intestines and secretes synthetic GLP-1. Appropriate signal peptides and penetratin are used to facilitate peptide secretion and intestinal uptake. Furthermore, we design a circuit with quorum sensing and double repressors, which aims to generate quick but sustainable responses and serves as an anti-noise filter. Plasmid stabilization modules including partition system and multimer resolution system are also incorporated to circumvent the undesirable loss or segregational instability of our artificial device. With this general concept of delivery of short peptide into human body, we can also target other human diseases with alternative circuit designs.	pcyang	Pan-Chyr Yang	None	None	Lino	Hsiao-Chun Huang	None	None	lbwang;bear20031;AndrewLi;cf221;popo;Angela;Ange;shihyi;Anjui;Edmund0610;Monkey781213;ray86047;JiangYingYu;delphiyoung;leep004;Jasmine;curtis999;charlotte_torng;oliverch77;Darlisereno	Liang Bo Wang;Tian-Shyang Shoung;Yen-Der Li;De-Hung Chen;Shan Chi Hsieh;Hsu Chia Jung;Chia-Jung Hsu;Shih-Yi Tseng;Anjui Wu;Cheng-Yeh Chen;Yu-hao liao;Jui-Tsen Yu;Jiang YingYu;Delphi Young;LEE, YI-TE;WANG, CHIEH-MEI;Kuo Chih-Chung;Wen Torng;Hung-Jen Chen;Hsin-Yu Lin	None	None	BBa_K817000	BBa_K817999

We planned to cultivate a special strain of genetically engineered cyanobacteria. With reductases metabolizing nitrogen, sulfur and carbon oxides, our organisms reduce three major pollutants in the modern day. Furthermore, we also focus on the removal of cadmium ions from soil. We tried to engineer E.coli to gain better capability of collecting cadmium ions. In fact, our engineered E.coli could stay inside of Dictyostelium discoideum, which allows us to build a biosafety system to make sure our GMOs won't become another threat to the environment.

In our current construction, the crtEBI operon directing lycopene biosynthesis is used as a reporter, allowing us to check our system's performance.  However, the possible applications of this system are extremely numerous. For example, controlling the expression of a toxin would allow creating a “suicidal bacterium” that would bring on its own death outside the specified temperature range.

However, issues of biosafety and ethics constrain the use of GEOs outside the lab. A primary concern is the Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) of synthetic genes to natural populations. Strategies developed to address this problem provide varying levels of containment, however, the substantial elimination of HGT remains difficult or perhaps impossible.    We have developed a new containment system to expand the range of environments where GEOs can be used safely. To do so, we rely on three levels of containment: physical containment with alginate capsules, semantic containment using an amber suppressor system, and an improved killswitch featuring delayed population-level suicide through complete genome degradation. We aim to raise the issue of biosafety by engaging the general public and scientific community through debate, and to advocate the discerning use of biosafety circuits in future iGEM projects.	ablindner	Ariel Lindner	None	None	adecrulle;ewintermute	Antoine Decrulle;Edwin Wintermute	None	None	iversondylan;GVillain;jrieders;jeancury;Denis.Samuylov;aprastowo;emordret;Claire09;zmarinkovic	Dylan Iverson;Guillaume VILLAIN;Julianne Rieders;Jean Cury;Denis Samuylov;Aishah Rumaysa Prastowo;Ernest Mordret;Claire Mayer;Zoran Marinkovic	Aleksandra;Babak;YangYifan	Aleksandra Nivina;Babak Nichabouri;Yang Yifan	BBa_K914000	BBa_K914999

To circumvent these, Peking iGEM has rationally constructed a hypersensitive sensor of luminance- Luminesensor. Primarily, the sensor was designed by fusing blue-light-sensing protein domain from Neurospora with DNA binding domain of LexA from E.coli, following which protein structure inspection and kinetic simulation were conducted to rationally perform optimization. Amazingly, Luminesensor was proved to be as sensitive as to sense natural light and even bioluminescence. With this sensor, spatiotemporal control of cellular behavior, such as phototaxis, high-resolution 2-D and 3-D bio-printing using dim light and even luminescence of iPad were shown to be very easy. What’s more, we successfully implemented cell-cell signaling using light, which is the very first time in synthetic biology and of great importance for biotechnological use.	qiPku	Qi Ouyang	None	None	Spring_zhq;Robinbin;YangYi	Haoqian Zhang;Shuobing Chen;Yi Yang	None	None	lidayi;TheTinaChen;Qingting;jintanshadow;xingwm;luckybear;Shrine;zhangzidong;zhanghong;Jiawei;niasw;LiHanxi;fam0259;edenling;AlexYY;Xianjun;Zhengcai;Renmei	Li Dayi;Tina Chen;Zhen Qiu;LIU Jintan;XING, WENMIN;Tian Lu;Hongyu Xiong;Zhang Zidong;ZHANG Hong;Yan Jiawei;Sun Sibai;Li Hanxi;YU Zhou;Lu Yang;Ye Yu;Xianjun Chen;Zhengcai Ma;Renmei Liu	None	None	BBa_K819000	BBa_K819999

We established a novel streamlined workflow for obtaining antibodies by incorporating all natural steps such as antibody maturation, selection and production in one genetic system implemented into a eukaryotic cell line. We stably transfect an antibody construct into CHO cells and mimic maturation by using the enzyme AID (activation-induced deaminase), which is known to induce somatic hypermutation. For selection, we are testing and deploying a versatile and continuous viral system as well as magnetic beads and cell sorting. Finally, a genetic switch enables the transition from surface expression to production of soluble antibodies. In addition, we pursue phage display with an antibody fragment to study mutation rate and evolution by AID in prokaryotes. Our system supersedes animal immunization, and the smooth process will increase the ready availability of antibodies in various formats.

On biofilm aggregation, expression of silica-binding peptides works to build silica matrices on the surface of cells. These matrices act as a mechanical filter for large particles and a barrier between the biofilm and fluid shear, decreasing dislodgment of organisms that could otherwise lead to fouling. We envision these improved biofilms being used in municipal water treatment to help recycle and filter home waste water streams, a concept we implemented in lab-scale membrane bioreactors.

Although much effort has gone into the production of ethanol, other biofuels, such as butanol, are superior. Butanol has a higher energy content, is less volatile, and is safer to use than ethanol. To develop strains of bacteria that produce high levels of 1-butanol we have introduced the genes coding for a biochemical pathway from Clostridium acetobutylicum into a mutant E. coli strain that produces a high level of NADH. The combination of these chemical pathways is predicted to increase the level of butanol production. Our second project, the Bacterial Etch-a-Sketch, features a complex network of gene expression and repression that enables a lawn of bacteria to respond to 470nm light. This task presents many engineering challenges: the bacteria need to be sensitive enough to respond to a laser pulse, yet selective enough to use in ambient lighting.	jstapleton	James Stapleton	None	None	Vershon	Andrew Vershon	None	None	avaghela;jwibrahim;Babu;Komal;eyt;SanaWajid	Anish Vaghela;Joseph Ibrahim;Archana Babu;Komal Trivedi;Eytan Biala;Sana Wajid	None	None	BBa_K787000	BBa_K787999

A high-energy diet, increases the amount of LPS-producing gut microbiota, and increased LPS levels has been observed in obese individuals. By inducing changes in the gut microbiota by prebiotics, like inulin, it is possible to decrease the plasma LPS level. This is associated with the stimulation of bifidobacterial growth. We have designed a novel approach to address this issue of plasma LPS, by probioticly induce changes in the gut flora by genetically modifying a bacteria to produce plant originated inulin. We cloned the two genes encoding sucrose:sucrose fructosyltransferase (SST) and fructose:fructose fructosyltransferase (FFT) from the Jerusalem artichoke into a E. coli, where it will produce inulin by using sucrose as an acceptor molecules. In the future this construct should be introduced by a probiotic lactobacillus, into the gut.	martinh	martin hanczyc	None	None	lclund;mbarnkob	Lars Christian Lund;Mike Barnkob	None	None	larsnorge;LisaG;Wronazky;SmokeySpartacus;andkj11;Idapp10;GabiOvergaard;Asbiorn;Reedorf;KKristianWürgler	Lars Norge Andreassen;Lisa Gundestrup;Andreas Wrona Jørgensen;Victor Vollesen;Andreas Kjær;Ida Appel;Gabi Overgaard;Asbjørn Müller;Malou Reedorf;Kristian Würgler Nielsen	AZA;jmollenhauer	Ann Zahle Andersen;Jan Mollenhauer	BBa_K899000	BBa_K899999

Hence, we come up with two innovative ways which have great advantages over the traditional one.  The first one, we try to take advantage of the bacteria's nature selection system. We construct a new plasmid which contains two types of genes, sweet and fatal for bacteria. Regularly, the sweet genes will be expressed, promoting the spread of bacteria transfer plasmid through conjugation. Once the amount of bacteria reaches a certain threshold, the dead gene will turn on, resulting in the death of the host bacteria.   The second method derive from the idea of dog-eat-dog, we attempt to cultivate a Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus strain, which live in cracking other bacteria. We consider to improve the sterilization efficiency to a certain bacteria.   All the two methods may avoid the probability of bacteria resistance at the same time.	whitecf	Yunfei Bai	None	None	fwang_seu;yppu_seu;fangxia_seu	Feng Wang;Yuepu Pu;Xia Fang	None	None	anyemelody;ziyou;Cassie;jiahaoruo;shawnna;poetdevin;Hpphins;Tiantang;xlan;LiWang;Moky;mokyII;MokyIII;fanzhou;Koala;EricMonty	yue hu;Yanjie Wang;Yaxian Zhou;Haoruo Jia;Xiao Han;Dadi Chioa;Ye ye;Dan Mo;ShengLan Zeng;Wang  Li;Gaowei Xu;Yu Ji;Xu Qian;he zhang;Rui Guan;Hongbo Xu	None	None	BBa_K873000	BBa_K873999

Distinct from linear DNA or RNA scaffolds in the traditional sense, the membrane protein system expands the dimension of reaction space, making possible the framework of numerous complex reactions on the two-dimensional plane, for example, switchable or circular reactions. In such a device, the membrane replaces DNA or RNA scaffolds as an extensive surface for proteins to anchor without limitation of expression amount. More importantly, by gathering the downstream enzymes through signal regulation, the reaction can be accelerated sharply. Besides, products can be transported much more efficiently from the inside to the outside of the cell in that the enzymes are tied to the membrane proteins. Hence the membrane is where the magic happens.	helin	Lin He	None	None	magang;ChobitParrot	Gang Ma;Wang You	None	None	Jucember;PorUnaCabeza;AleAlejandro;Yangjinglin;Jinzhenm;shaobozhang;zhiantinglan;linghanhu;ljcsinging;huanan1991;zhouyiwei;JenniferZhang;actin;albertwyq;songyuanhao;Stephen.W;Luke	Suo Yang;Xi Rui;Guo Huaqing;Jinglin Yang;Jin Zhenming;Shaobo Zhang;Yineng Yu;LINGHAN HU;Jingchang Li;Nan Hua;Zhou Yi Wei;Zhang Yuehan;YIN Ruonan;WU Yuqi;Yuanhao Song;Wu Jiajie;Shiyi Liu	xzt	Xie Zhitao	BBa_K771000	BBa_K771999

To approach the second question, the Hell Cell subgroup developed BioBricks that allow a cell to survive harsh extraterrestrial conditions. Such a toolset could create a space-ready synthetic organism to perform useful functions off-world. For example, the Biomining branch attempted to engineer bacteria to recycle used electronics by degenerating silica and extracting metal ions in situ. The Venus Life subproject grappled with the third key astrobiological question by exploring Carl Sagan’s theory that life could exist in Venusian clouds. To this end, Venus Life designed a cell-cycle reporter to test for growth in aerosol within an adapted Millikan apparatus. Through this triad of projects, Stanford-Brown iGEM aimed to illuminate synthetic biology’s value as a tool for astrobiology.

We measure the the terminator efficiency by measuring the GFP and RFP which are placed before and after terminators. The efficiency calculated from theoretical model fit quite well with experimental results.

Truncating an enzyme previously shown to limit counterproductive metabolic regulation in terpenoid synthesis, together with a genetic construct design enabling the setup of a modular biofactory, potentially poses a foundation for applied interchangeable systems in synthetic biology. The need for reliable promoters for P. pastoris is addressed by characterizing four inducible promoters as standardized parts useful in controlling gene expression, with GFP as a reporter. The functionality of peroxisome-targeting signal PTS1 for use on the C-terminus of gene products is also analyzed. Difficulties in designing laboratory protocols and engineering genetic constructs are approached by developing a multi-purpose software tool to solve methodological obstacles, as well as facilitating implementation of a modular design on future projects.

It interacts with the anti-Shine-Dalgarno (ASD) sequence in the 16S rRNA in the ribosome to initiate protein translation. By mutate the basepair in the SD and ASD sequence, we produced an orthogonal translation system where the canonical ribosome cannot translate the orthogonal mRNA, and vice versa. We call this system O-Key. Using the O-Key, we are able to strictly control the synthesis of desired product and prevent potential contamination to the publics and environment. We can even build a completely new orthogonal phage that can only infect our engineered E. coli. With these successful examples, we demonstrated a bright and secure future that guarantees the safety of the human and environment with our O-Key.	yingjinyuan	Yingjin Yuan	None	None	None	None	None	None	Jiabin;austinamens;RenHengqian;mlplgs;AramaryShao;zhangjinlai;Pinglanwang;blueviola;YangLi;dreamsll;helengood;ni;Blue;toushirou_1220;happywwyf;lichao	Bin Jia;Qinfeng Wu;Hengqian Ren;Shu Gong;Yifeng Shao;Jinlai Zhang;Dongchang Qin;Xiaonan Cheng;Yang Li;Linlin Song;Jiaquan Liu;Lingli Ni;Yapeng Su;Andi Wangzhou;Yufei Wei;Chao Li	None	None	BBa_K821000	BBa_K821999

For this purpose we have chosen the E. coli strain Nissle 1917 which has been used for many years as a probiotic. We designed a robust gene guard system regulated by a novel and easy to control inducible cumate switch that activates the production of a human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 that can kill the bacteria and also avoid horizontal transfer.   The safe probiotic constructed here can be used to produce nutritious, preventive or therapeutic molecules.

Hopefully, the construction of these modules in the cell will be achieved, with the help of the site-specific recombination systems. Feedforward control theory is introduced into the module and mechanism on the behavior has long been under our analysis, all aiming at a better performance of the logic gate.

Pre-set a ‘switch-on’ temperature and a ‘switch-off’ temperature, in silico simulation will give the sequence of the regulatory RNA that meet the requirement.    A step further, we apply our ‘Designable Thermoswitches’ to the field of fermentation industry.  For a long time, engineers are trying to find a more economic and more automatic way to extract fermentation product inside the engineered microorganism.  We align our ‘Designable Thermoswitches’ and gene of lysozyme together and put them into E.Coli to solve this problem.  The reconstructed E.Coli will switch on the procedure of self-lysate at the given temperature.  Thus, the fermentation product inside the engineered microorganism can be released.

The extensive use of fertilizers and the inability of sewage treatment plants to break down drug waste lead to increasingly high concentrations of so-called endocrine disruptors in rivers. As a result, male fish have been found to be less fertile and even develop female sex tissue, so called ovotesties. Since fish spawn is constantly exposed to river waters, fish development is easily disturbed, and while the ratio of female fish increases, population numbers decrease. For sensing we use a membrane-bound receptor of Danio rerio. Activation will lead to bioluminescence which can be read out by photometric measurement.

With annual production exceeding 100 million tons (2010), it creates an issue of PET waste. In Western countries less than 70% of PET production is recovered by recycling. Biological processes play no role so far, only expensive chemical processes are applicable yet. PET waste left to erosion in the environment creates nanoparticles which tend to accumulate toxic substances. This poses a growing environmental threat and a serious health risk. Thus, developing new methods for PET degradation has become an urgent issue. Team TUD designed a bacterial recycling system that uses PET waste as a resource for synthesis of new chemical compounds. The proposed solution pursues PET decomposition into its monomers, transportation into E. coli and leading via terephthalic acid (TPA) to a high-value end product. The latter’s specification is determined by the inserted enzymes to build new metabolic pathways.

This practice often requires placing large enzymatic pathways into one cell. Production of the desired product is usually affected by increased metabolic burden or negative feedback on the cell. In nature, however, many organisms work symbiotically to accomplish a task and/or provide mutual benefits to one another. For the first part of our project, we have studied two systems to create cellular codependence in E. coli - using either pairs of auxotrophs or toxin/antitoxins.

The GS gene was cloned on a methanococcal shuttle vector downstream of a strong promoter, and transformation of methanococci was confirmed via PCR.  GS catalyzes the conversion of geranyl diphosphate, an intermediate in biosynthesis of the isoprenoid lipids of these archaea, to geraniol, the major aromatic compound in roses and a potential biofuel. Small amounts of geraniol biosynthesis were detected in cultures of the transformants by GC/MS.  Methanogens are archaea that live in the guts of humans and animals and are responsible for the methane content of flatulence.  Thus, this project could convert personal polluters into an air freshener.  Because of the prevalence of flatulence among the aging population of the United States, the potential impact of this research is very high.	UGA	Yajun Yan	None	None	wbwhitman	William B.

Therefore, a modular RNA binding protein is an invaluable tool for gene regulation. The PUF domain of human PUM1 gene contains eight tandem repeats, each recognizing one of the four nucleotide bases. In theory, a PUF protein can be programmed to recognize any 8-nt ssRNA sequence. Here we demonstrate that PUF can be tethered with other functional domains for applications in E. Coli. Specifically, we show that a PUF/endonuclease fusion protein acts as RNA scissors, silencing gene expression through site specific mRNA cleavage. PUF was also tethered to split GFP to test its ability to co-localize proteins using a RNA scaffold. PUF biobricks offer a wide range of possible functions including gene expression modulation and scaffolding of metabolic pathways.	courtevans	Courtney Evans	None	None	rao12;kbhalerao;ysjin;joannema	Chris Rao;Kaustubh Bhalerao;Yong-Su Jin;Joanne Manaster	None	None	angelalovestheworld;achau;bchen26;schorna2;kirchho2;tankasa2;ukuzma2;iramos4;Adi25	Hsiao-Han Chen;Anthony Chau;Bob Chen;Cara Schornak;Asha Kirchhoff;Divya Tankasala;Uros Kuzmanovic;Isiah Ramos;Aditya Malik	KoriDunn;Ahmetbadur;Toddfreestone;bradevans	Kori Dunn;Ahmet Badur;Todd Freestone;Brad Evans	BBa_K865000	BBa_K865999

In this project, we are going to develop an exceptional natural tool that could be used to optimize bio-production pathways: the integron. Integrons are genetic platforms which contain (re)movable gene cassettes. These integrons are mostly known to carry resistances to antibiotics. They are flanked with recombination sites which allow gene shuffling inside the integron thanks to a specific enzyme: the integrase. With appropriate selective pressure, this shuffling should result in optimized production.  As a proof of concept, we are going to produce two antibiotics: Microcin C7 and Microcin B17. Two bacteria possessing the integron containing the antibiotics production gene cassettes, the integrase and a low resistance to the opposite antibiotic will be put in competition.   With the integrase, we could change the natural order of the genes in order to optimize production.

Current methods to clean black crust are either too destructive or non-effective. The aim of our project is to develop a system to more gently restore statues and monuments. To achieve this goal, we engineered E. coli to eat the black crust. More specifically, we introduced an aerobic sulfate reducing pathway and a hydrogen sulfide producing pathway into E. coli. In this way, the sulfate component of the black crust is transformed into a gas, thereby degrading the offending substance without degrading the original material of the statue. In addition to our black crust project, we developed a ratiometric fluorescence platform to test transcriptional terminators and subsequently used the platform to compare the efficiencies of T7 and E. coli transcriptional terminators with T7 and E. coli RNA polymerases.	olivierjousson	Olivier Jousson	None	None	cridelbianco;protocell	Cristina Del Bianco;Sheref Mansy	None	None	Tassa;daniele.rossetto;Giacomo;anna.d;jasonfweb;F.Guzz	Andrea Tassinari;Daniele Rossetto;Giacomo Giacomelli;Anna Depetris;Jason Fontana;Francesco Guzzonato	lmartini;robymarcia	Laura Martini;Roberta Lentini	BBa_K731000	BBa_K731999

Where attempts at physical removal and biodegradable plastics have failed to solve this pollution disaster, synthetic biology steps in. UCL’s project proposes the bioremediation of microplastic waste by two systems: degradation using a laccase enzyme or aggregation by controlled expression of curli. Ultimately we envisage the construction of habitable islands - turning waste into a resource. We used novel chassis: two marine bacteria, Oceanibulbus indoliflex  and Roseobacter denitrificans. In line with considering the viability of our project, we questioned the access ordinary citizens should have to these tools.

Serious infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria are a global healthcare problem. As the discovery of new antibiotics lags behind, we are developing new methods for targeting the resistance itself  - making resistant bacteria sensitive to old antibiotics once again. Working with real-world resistance genes from multi-resistant bacteria isolated at hospitals, we are developing anti-resistance systems to strike at three different levels: DNA, transcriptional and translational level.    At DNA level, we develop a method for increasing resistance plasmid loss rate.  At transcriptional level, we use super-repressors to repress transcription of resistance genes and native defense mechanisms.  At translational level, we develop a modular system for high-throughput screening of sRNAs to silence resistance genes.    We also provide tools useful for the whole synbio community, such as new standard backbones and methods for scarless gene deletion.

To help solve the problem, we design a gene circuit which can both detect and defend against the phages. We use the modified promoter pRM to sense the phage’s infection and initiate the defence. The lysis gene which can make bacteria lyse is installed in our circuit. When it works, the phage won’t be able to take advantage of its host to replicate any longer. To win more time for lysis to function well, we design antisense RNA to prevent the phage from turning into lytic life cycle. Thus, when the lysis protein kills the host, the phage is still at lysogenic life cycle or the newly assembled phages are still immature. By using the quorum sensing system, the bacteria around the host will prepare to defend in advance. Attribute to these parts, our bacteria survive.

In this approach, biological design guides both experiments and mathematical modeling, but is it possible to use experimental data to reversely engineer the mathematical model and guide backwards the biological design? This project answers the question. We use reverse engineering techniques to get mathematical models such as ordinary differential equations(ODEs), directly from the experimental data and build the feasible designs according to the models. In this sense, we not only fully connect biology, experiments and mathematics, but also get feasible designs that have certain behaviors.

These applications include artificial tendons and ligaments, biomedical sutures, athletic gear, parachute cords, air bags, and other yet discovered products which require a high tensile strength with amazing extendibility. Spiders however cannot be farmed because they are territorial and cannibalistic. Thus, an alternative to producing spider silk must be found. We aim to engineer spider silk genes into E. coli to produce this highly valuable product. Spider silk production in bacteria has been limited due to the highly repetitive nature of the spider silk amino acids in the protein. To overcome this obstacle we are using various synthetic biology techniques to boost spider silk protein production and increase cellular fitness. After successful production, spider silk protein is artificially spun into usable fibers and tested for physical properties.	cdmiller	Charles Miller	None	None	None	None	None	None	ahalling;Jamal2300;TomUsu;skiracer96;Fede;cwbarentine;ryanputman;canyoncatalyst;elizmartinez;swethac	Andrea Halling;Jamal Abdinor;Thomas Harris;Kathleen Miller;Federico Carlos Rodriguez;Charles Barentine;Ryan Putman;Brian Smith;Elizabeth Martinez;Swetha Chandrasekar	arahman;cankerz;Joshuatodd1;catramp	Asif Rahman;Cameron Copeland;Joshua Ellis;Cody Tramp	BBa_K844000	BBa_K844999

Quorum signaling allows bacteria to communicate with each other through the use of chemical signals. Bacteria use this form of signaling in nature to coordinate their behavior. Using three quorum signaling molecules we create unique connections between different populations of engineered bacteria and perform coordinated computing functions. We design and characterize standard and novel modules such as toggle switches, oscillators, signal propagators, and logic gates. As compared to engineering molecular circuitry in single populations, we aim to show that the synergistic approach to information processing leads to improved, scalable, and tunable operation.

It is a novel proposal of synthetic ecology, based on the use of an efficient photosynthesizer (the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus) modified to become an exporter of sucrose and diel switch of the activity of Aliivibrio fischeri, a marine bacterium widely known for its bioluminescent properties in response to quorum sensing signals. Our modified cyanobacteria feed the population of A. fischeri through a transporter protein and produce AHL to induce bioluminescence in response to the activity of a photosensitive operator, which would activate only at night. We also have tried to transform different microalgae with bioluminescence genes to test their effectiveness. We look forward to develop an efficient and autosufficient environmentally friendly biolamp, with potential application to cover the illumination needs of many infrastructure sectors.	jfurchue	Javier Urchueguía	None	None	None	None	None	None	crimaca;aurfor;Antropoteuthis;Juan_Luis;daie07;Roocfer;irewija;Jesterface;Gonzalo;essanchi27;ruthvlc;konestich	CRISTINA MAS CANO;Arantxa Urchueguía;Alejandro Damián Serrano;Juan Luis Reig Valiente;Elia Pérez León;Rocío Ochoa Fernández;Irene Guijarro García;Ismael Mullor Ruiz;Gonzalo de Oyanguren Aparicio;Estefanía Sánchez Chicharro;Ruth Sanz Tamarit;Miguel Angel Gaspar Celda	gamermann;divadfu;masiupau;Arnau	Daniel Gamermann;David Fuente Herraiz;Maria Siurana;Arnau Montagud	BBa_K754000	BBa_K754999

We do. We have designed, constructed and characterized an inter-specific translator based on light pulses that allows to literally dialogue with microorganisms. We have built seven biobricks with fluorescent proteins under the control of environmentally-sensitive promoters. The process is as follows: human voice messages are electronically- and then light-encoded in excitation wavelengths, and microbial proteins’ emission wavelengths are electronically- and voice-encoded back. We have used this system to find out the fermentative status of budding yeast and to dialogue with E. coli allowing it to answer questions such as “are you hungry?” The three pillars of our project (human practices, modeling and wetlab) yielded continuous feedback with each other, illustrating an integrated interdisciplinary approach.

The bacteria used for the degradation of the waste was Bacillus subtilis genetically modified to include the part BBa_J45014 which codes for banana smell. This was included to ensure a more pleasant smell during the working of the fuel cell and also provides an indicator for the battery life of the cell. Pseudomonas aeuroginosa was also used as a helper bacterium in the generation of electricity. The preliminary results indicated a production of banana odour by the bacteria. However, preliminary tests with the first MFC design did not result in a measurable electricity generation. Further tests with a different salt bridge composition and fuel cell design are underway to arrive at an efficient cell that produces a sizable electricity output that could be used to power small electrical devices.	reena.b	B.

Our team implemented broadly applicable methods to optimize biological systems through directed evolution, light-regulated gene expression, and computer aided protein design. We characterized light-inducible protein expression systems for multichromatic tuning of biological pathways. To provide an inexpensive method for tuning gene expression with light, we developed a tablet application that is freely available. We also used computer-aided design to develop proteins that more effectively bind isotypes of the flu protein Hemagglutinin. Finally, we implemented a continuous culture device (turbidostat) in order to apply directed evolution to the metabolism of ethylene glycol in E. coli. We have termed the research conducted this year “Apptogenetics” as all projects utilize purpose-built computational applications for biological research.

PCC 6803 and Escherichia coli	Saffron is highly valued as a spice that adds unmatched flavor, aroma, and color to food. A project was designed to synthesize three chemicals which compose a significant portion of the aroma and coloration of the spice saffron: safranal, picrocrocin, and crocin. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was chosen as the chassis because of its photosynthetic nature and native production of the substrate, zeaxanthin. It was proposed that the cloning of two genes ZCD and UGTCs2, would be sufficient to make the compounds in this organism.  These two were cloned into E. coli in conjunction with the genes necessary to produce zeaxanthin.  ZCD was successfully cloned into E. coli with the aid of a fusion protein to minimize the presence of inclusion bodies.  This result was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by trypsin digestion and LC-MS/MS. With this groundwork laid, future work can produce a biosynthetic alternative to saffron.	jjez	Joseph Jez	None	None	None	None	None	None	BrianBasco;andrew.ng;lucasharr;caf392	Brian Basco;Andrew Ng;Lucas B.

To make this possible, intron sequences are used to flank non-protein parts embedded in coding sequences. An intron sequence with an embedded recombination site is capable of in vivo insertion of a compatible protein fusion part. As an example, a GFP-fusion was created with an intervening lox site that is removed from the final protein using the intron to form a fully functional GFP protein.	ingalls	Brian Ingalls	None	None	None	None	None	None	honpeter;kkarpins;abiskup;mthiagar;lyianndga;hbandukw;rachowdh;aaronb;dlieuson;a3dhawan;AnjaliA.;paulreginato;d2chhina;ebibra;Lilycloud;siburru;ukishor;ecpgieicg;j22truon;v5vuong	Joon Hyuk Hong;Katarzyna Karpinska-Leydier;Angela Biskupovic;Madhuran Thiagarajah;Linda Yang;Hina Bandukwala;Rummy A.

According to the latest Cancer Stem Cell Theory, not all the cancer cells have the same ability to generate new tumors. Tumor growth is mostly driven by a small proportion of cells, the CSCs. In addition to having high proliferation rates, CSCs are more resistant to chemotherapy. This indicates that while regular cancer cells are killed, CSCs may remain unaffected and give rise to new tumors once the treatment stops.     CSCs produce increased levels of a particular enzyme, Aldehyde Dehydrogenase. We have identified its 3 most frequent isoforms (ALDH1A1, ALDH1A3 and ALDH3A1)in aggressive types of cancer, and used their gene promoters to build our CSC-targeting constructs: the iSTEM -Intelligent Synthetic Tumor Eliminating Machine.	mbmoc	Mark Clements	None	None	HowardBoland	Howard Boland	None	None	moyin;Rad;Sara_Jane;s.berciano;karinford;Louise123;priyashankar;neil;Hima;Aaskin;anasokolovic;tkounenis	Moyin Odugbemi;Radoslaw Kwasniak;Caroline Champion;Silvia Berciano Benitez;Karin Ford;Louise Usher;ShanmugaPriya Subramaniam;shreenil odedra;Hima puthussery;Annalie Askin;Ana Sokolovic;Thanos Kounenis	None	None	BBa_K940000	BBa_K940999

An incomplete knowledge base of developmental mechanisms impedes stem cell research and innovation. The iDifferentiate system is a genetic engineering platform that may be used to elucidate differentiation pathways of any cell type for which there is a known lineage-specific cis-regulatory element. To demonstrate this system we developed the SAVE Assay, which uses visual cues to indicate the overall quantity and relative percentage of atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes amongst differentiated stem cells. The assay uses a dual plasmid system that selects for successfully transformed stem cells via neomycin and puromycin resistance along with fluorescent reporter genes regulated by atrial and ventricular promoters. Altering the basic protocol by using different reagents and induction factors will allow scientists to quickly and accurately determine differentiation pathways of two or more related cell types.

We put GFP equipped with degradation tags in downstream to illuminate our numbers and change them quickly as well. Considering our engineering background, we accordingly employ cell immobilization to build our device. Engineering bacteria have been embedded in intra-hallow calcium alginate microcapsules and in PDMDAAC-NaCS microcapsules, respectively. In addition, 3D CAD design is performed for a perfect device.  Our genetic circuits vary in length and RBS strength, leading to different durations of time delay for GFP expression. This inspired us to extend our work last year. By altering the strength of RBS at five grades, another five circuits have been built. After the induction by arabinose, the duration of response time for GFP expression increases as the strength of RBS declines, bringing about a time-course display.

The scaffold allows efficient channeling of substrates to products over several enzymatic steps by limiting the diffusion of intermediates thus providing a bright future for solving the problem.

Using cell cytometry (FACS) and fluorimetry, we demonstrated in yeast the successful expression and translational regulation of a fusion of mRNA binding protein and fluorescent protein. These results, along with published parameter values, were used to predict via deterministic and stochastic models that the probability of successful bistability for our switch was 0.96%, but this could be improved theoretically to a maximum of 51.27% by limiting the range of variation of the most sensitive parameters.  The models also predicted that co-operative binding of the mRNA binding protein to its mRNA stem loop was essential for generating switch-like behaviour.  These results suggest that a translationally regulated genetic toggle switch is a viable and novel engineering concept applicable to medicinal, environmental and technological problems.	i.stansfield	Ian Stansfield	None	None	ebenhoeh;y.saka;DuncanShaw;romano;marco_thiel	Oliver Ebenhoeh;Yasushi Saka;Duncan Shaw;M.

Democratizing Synthetic Biology will demand fundamental advances to make DNA construction easier and cheaper, thereby enabling broader access to biotechnology by the public. Our team has tackled this challenge with the design of an inexpensive self-contained kit called GENOMIKON, currently targeted for the high school and DIY communities but with clear potential for professional use. The kit contains prefabricated parts that are sequentially assembled on a solid support using cycle times of 5 min./part with a coupling efficiency of ~95%. The parts exist with sufficient diversity and quantity for hundreds of unique experiments. The kit is accompanied by an online resource that serves as lab manual, notebook, information management system and social network for the exchange of ideas.

In addition, we have developed inexpensive and easily assembled lab equipment such as a gel electrophoresis apparatus and a PCR thermal cycler.

These easy to culture and robust organisms are also a desirable eukaryotic chassis for synthetic biology, but there are few tools for delivering biomolecules into these organisms. So, we engineered E. coli to deliver proteins and/or DNA payloads into these bacteria-devouring eukaryotes. Once ingested, our E. coli are programmed to self-lyse and porate the phagosome, releasing their payloads into the cytosol. This delivery mechanism has the potential to deliver payload to any phagocytic organism with a cholesterol-based membrane. As part of our parallel software effort to rework the Clotho plugin environment and API, we made automatic biosafety handling an intrinsic feature of the core. Together, these tools provide a foundation for metazoan synthetic biology and a framework for improving safety in our field.	JCAnderson	Chris Anderson	None	None	tdj	Terry D.

By using directed evolution, we aim to modulate the receptor binding domain to enable the interaction with similar phenolic substances like capsaicin. Brought into E. coli, this modulated system will induce light effects of different intensities - depending on the concentration of capsaicin respectively the spiciness of the sample. The capsaicin detection is a proof of principle concept.

Biofilms commonly cause complications in both industrial and medical settings and represent a significant source of morbidity and mortality. A synthetic biology approach to tackling biofilms has only recently been applied to Escherichia coli biofilms.

Production of these intermediates is currently triggered by inefficient methods, such as chemical inputs (tetracycline, estrogen-analogs, arabinose, etc) or drastic changes to the cellular environment (pH, oxygen levels, temperature, etc). On an industrial scale, this chemical induction requires large quantities of reagents and extensive purification, while environmental induction requires conditions that can adversely affect cell vitality and yield. To this end, we have designed an E. coli genetic circuit that can pass through four stable states of protein production triggered solely by ON/OFF patterns of light. To efficiently test the components of our circuit, we have also created a system for the transient delivery of transcription factors through the cell and nuclear membranes. With this production method, we can link multiple synthesis steps to a single, clean and rapidly scalable input.	areich	Adrian Reich	None	None	rhet;szswartz;djd	Gary Wessel;Zak Swartz;Diana J.

A major stumbling block however, is often an inability to express functional protein.  This situation is difficult to manage and troubleshoot as it is often unclear why expression is failing. We have designed a system that can accurately and visually report whether a gene is being transcribed and/or translated. The system also differentiates whether expression is failing due to misfolding in the periplasm or cytoplasm.  In the case of misfolding, our system can also fine tune expression levels of a given protein to optimize production, increasing the likelihood of obtaining functional protein.  To further understand protein misfolding we have built an equation-based, multivariant model of inclusion body formation.  Finally, we used a series of podcasts to explore the social implications of our project in the context of the growing synthetic biology industry.	clogan	Cairine Logan	None	None	None	None	None	None	jdchoo;cktang;h.dastidar;raidakhwaja;dvyas;Emily_Hicks;pjwu;ajgrigg	Jeremy Choo;Christopher Tang;Himika Ghosh Dastidar;Raida Khwaja;Dev Vyas;Emily Hicks;Patrick Wu;Alexander Grigg	pauladamiak;DCurran	Paul Adamiak;Dave Curran	BBa_K339000	BBa_K339999

Taking genes from fireflies and Vibrio fischeri, the Cambridge team have constructed BioBricks which allow light output at a wide range of wavelengths.  Firefly luciferase is already used as a reporter, but requires continual addition of the expensive substrate luciferin.  We have created codon-optimised operons combining luciferase with a luciferin regenerating enzyme (LRE).  This allows recycling of luciferin for sustained light output. In addition, we have submitted the first lux operon to the registry, taking genes from bacteria which form symbiotic relationships with squid.  This is the first BioBrick to emit light without addition of substrate and can be used as a reporter with any promoter. These two approaches will allow cheaper assays with brighter signals.

This year, iGEM CHIBA is constructing genetic double-click system whose output is released only when the input (inducing agent) is given twice within a limited time. To discriminate double-click from two separated single-clicks, the 1st input is to be memorized temporarily. If the 2nd input is added before the memory gets lost, output will be produced. If the 2nd input is not added within the given time, the system will be reset to the original state. This mechanism could work as a sort of safety device; by requiring the 2nd 'confirmation' input, one can drastically reduce, or even eliminate, the frequency of false-inputs.

For the application of this project and others, we are also developing a high throughput gene expression screen for synthetic gene libraries and codon variants, allowing for the possibility of tunable gene expression levels.	jingdongtian	Jingdong Tian	None	None	None	None	None	None	zhup;nicholastang;SFenu;kchien;aang	Peter Zhu;Nicholas Tang;Stefano Fenu;Kevin Chien;Andrew Ang	MaggieQ	Jiayuan Quan	BBa_K429000	BBa_K429999

Synthetic biology and iGEM have long?attempted to refine this process of 'bridge-building'. The 2010 University of Edinburgh team has applied this idea comprehensively throughout their project. The BRIDGE protocol (BioBrick Recombineering In Direct Genome Editing) is a protocol for markerless insertion of BioBricks onto the bacterial chromosome, which will bridge ideas and reality in synthetic biology. Bacterial BRIDGEs aim to foster non-chemical means of communication between bacteria by pairing light-producing and light-sensing BioBricks; future teams may make use of them in a variety of novel applications. Finally, human BRIDGEs examine synthetic biology as ways of thinking and the permeation of human aspects, bridging the so-called 'divides' between disciplines and individuals.

The EPFL iGEM project aims to stop malaria propagation by acting on the vector: the mosquito. We are engineering Asaia, a bacterium that naturally lives in the mosquito's gut, to express an immunotoxin that can prevent the malaria agent Plasmodium falciparum from infecting the mosquito, thereby eliminating the transmission of this parasite to humans. Asaia is an organism that is easy to grow and genetically manipulate. We are establishing Asaia as a new chassis so that future iGEM teams can quickly and efficiently engineer new and more potent Asaia strains.

Although the assembly was successful, the resulting detector is leaky with measurable RFP even in conditions with no iron present. In our lab environment, we found that it was necessary to work with relatively high concentrations of bacteria and DNA.

In the AOX pathway, electrons are transferred from ubiquonone to AOX, and then directly used to reduce oxygen. The drop in the electric potential energy of the electrons transferred from AOX to oxygen is dissipated as heat. Our project has focused on 1) cloning the AOX gene from a thermogenic plant (Sacred Lotus) into E. coli to induce a thermogenic response to a cold-shock, and 2) calculating a theoretical rate of heat production per bacterial colony to select for an appropriate calorimetric technique. Further, numerical methods in MATLAB will be employed to model the steady-state temperature profile of the synthetic bacterial colony, and to potentially corroborate later experimental findings. Engineering a controlled thermogenic response in bacteria could lead to improved bacterial functioning in cold shock environments.

Hydrophobicity keeps a surface clean and dry preventing micro-organisms from attaching to a surface. Most chemical  coatings used presently are costly or harmful to the environment. Our idea is to engineer Bacillus subtilis which when applied to a surface, automatically forms a hydrophobic biofilm coating. Succesful biofilm formation will serve as a trigger for the expression of hydrophobic proteins called Chaplins. The result of this process will be a rigid biofilm with embedded hydrophobic proteins, leaving a coated surface which is extremely hydrophobic. Producing a self-assembling hydrophobic biofilm is cheap, there is no high-tech treatment involved and there are no hazardous chemicals necessary to attain a hydrophobic coating. Applications of this hydrophobic biofilm range from anti-fouling coatings on ships to anti-corrosion coatings used to protect sensory equipment.	oscarkuipers	Oscar Kuipers	None	None	jwveening;dclaessen	Jan-Willem Veening;Dennis Claessen	None	None	Ptr;Ekkers;joelkuiper;Geeske;djokehendriks;MJvdN;LauravdS;AJ;neima;aslomp;jorrithillebrand;ramon	Peter Roemers;David Ekkers;Joël Kuiper;Geeske van Heel;Djoke Hendriks;Maarten van den Nieuwenhof;Laura van der Straat;Arend Jan Suk;Hacer Ezgi KARAKA;Arend Slomp;Jorrit Hillebrand;ramon sieber	Wilfred	Wilfred Poppinga	BBa_K305000	BBa_K305999

The iGEM Team Heidelberg 2010 unlocks the world of synthetic microRNAs, since focusing solely on DNA has often been inconvenient for medical purposes. We engineered a toolkit for standardized measurements of interactions between artificial miRNAs and their binding sites. From this data we were able to compute an in silico model integrating binding site properties and knockdown percentages. Thus, the expression level of any gene of choice could be arbitrarily adjusted by employing the corresponding binding site design. To produce tissue specific miRNA gene shuttles, we developed an evolution-based method for synthesis of new adeno associated viruses. This enabled us to overcome the natural limitations of virus selectivity. In the future, miBricks could be applied for treatment of diseases like Diabetes and Hemophilia, opening the doors to new Synthetic Biology based medical approaches.	jenskeienburg	Jens Keienburg	None	None	mayermat	Matthias Mayer	None	None	FriederikeKöppe;Dima;Ola;aasthamathur04;Jude;Rebecca;ThomasU;Lorenz;dniopek;AlejandroHD;Laura_Nadine;Stefan_N;kleinsorg;janulrich;philippbayer;leaflocke;rudolf;Elenina;MarcusPodewski;Xiaoting;mbechtle	Friederike Köppe;Dmytro Mayilo;Aleksandra Anna Kolodziejczyk;Aastha Mathur;Jude Al-Sabah;Rebecca Berrens;Thomas Uhlig;Lorenz Kurt Adlung;Dominik Niopek;Alejandro Macias-Torre;Laura-Nadine Schuhmacher;Stefan Neumann;Stefan Kleinsorg;Jan-Ulrich Schad;Philipp Bayer;Lea Flocke;Rudolf Pisa;Elena Cristiano;Marcus Podewski;Xiaoting Wu;Marina Bechtle	reils;Docdirk;Kath;cchoe;cliesche;PGA	Roland Eils;Dirk Grimm;Kathleen Boerner;Charley Choe;Clarissa Liesche;Paula Gonzalez	BBa_K337000	BBa_K337999

To accomplish this, we are constructing chimeric quorum sensing receptors that can localize on Lactobacillus membrane and detect autoinducing peptides (AIPs) released by S. aureus. The ligand binding to the chimeric receptor will trigger downstream plnABCD pathway and initiate the synthesis and secretion of RNAIII inhibiting peptide (RIP), a heptapeptide with proven effectiveness in attenuating S. aureus virulence. The possibility of achieving this lies in the structural homology of the catalytic domain of the quorum sensing receptors in Lactobacillus and S. aureus. Both receptors belong to the HPK10 subfamily of a two-component histidine kinase family. Attenuation of S. aureus virulence by quorum-sensing inhibitors should not yield a strong selective pressure for development of resistance, and would therefore be an attractive concept for preventive medicine.	kinglchow	King L.

We aim to control their production in E.  coli thanks to a new part: a strong promoter sensitive to the shaking speed and the temperature of the water bath. By controlling this production, our team focuses on two final purposes : (1) the granule as a storage system for overproduced lipids with medical applications, such as DHA or EPA and (2) the granule as self-cleaving micro-beads in order to purify a recombinant protein of interest. In bacteria, three separate monofunctional enzymes are required for PHA synthesis. In order to improve this pathway, we intend to model a single multifunctional enzyme based on the study of natural evolution of fatty acid synthesis in animals.	phlejeune	Philippe Lejeune	None	None	NAT;Arnaud;aX	Nathalie Isorce;Arnaud Rondelet;axel cournac	None	None	banban;Florent;Gersand;Chambi;pYzou;Coralieandco;marnault;Emilie;Philou;MelanieGeffroy;magalimariani;achevrel;magalbrun;Carole;Margaux;Blandine;Mathilde	alban EDOUARD-ARMAND;Florent Masson;Sandra OKALA;Gaël Chambonnier;Pierre-Yves Zundel;Coralie VIOLLET;Mathilde ARNAULT;Emilie Poller;Philippe Thomas;Mélanie Geffroy;Magali Mariani;anne chevrel;Marie-Amedee Galbrun;Carole Rabouille;Jaulin Margaux;Blandine Deschamps;Mathilde GUZZO	sboumahdi	Soufiane Boumahdi	BBa_K342000	BBa_K342999

Anyone who wants to enjoy bathing in natural bodies of water in or near areas populated by humans or livestock may encounter unsafe levels of enteric bacteria.  Contemporary methods of assessing water quality have a slow turn-around time so we have taken steps to perfect a biosensor for rapidly indirectly quantifying the presence of enteric bacteria in natural water samples through the detection of quorum sensing factors.  Previous IGEMS have exploited the LuxR/pLux system for the detection of a variety of N-acylhomoserine lactone autoinducers. We have taken steps to further perfect a biosensor based on this device by transforming a gram-positive bacteria host to eliminate any background autoinducer signal and to build-in an enzymatic 'read-out' to obtain an analog output.  We envision the development of a handheld monitor that uses this IGEM biosensor, immobilized on input paper strips, to rapidly detect unsafe levels of enteric bacteria in water samples.	geotwaddle	George Twaddle	None	None	mentash	Amro Mentash	None	None	Joehull;dgarvey;SusanYang;rchamberlin;ChanceTheChase;h.caparell	Joseph Hull;dylan garvey;Hun Young Yang;Rachelle Chamberlin;Irene Fahrberger;Holly G.

Past iGEM projects have used chemical or optical stimuli to actuate transcriptional responses. Our project, however, seeks to add voltage sensitivity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Baker's yeast was chosen because in some sense yeast have a system that responds to voltage input. With a voltage stimulus one can open the voltage-gated calcium channels of yeast, causing calcium ions to rush into the cytoplasm. This causes calcineurin to dephosphorylate Crz1, which enters the nucleus and binds various promoters. Our group presents a library of characterized Crz1-sensitive promoters of both naturally-occurring and synthetic varieties. Genes downstream of these promoters are thus voltage-regulated in media containing calcium.	oster@jhu.edu	Marc Ostermeier	None	None	caiyizhi;doctorbee54	Yizhi Cai;Jef Boeke	None	None	jrporter;AndrewSnavely;arjunkhakhar;zguo7;nyoung;SunPenguin;Jlemoel;Danielwolozny;hma7;rpassar3;kboulier	Justin Porter;Andrew Snavely;Arjun Khakhar;Zheyuan Guo;Noah Young;Ang Andy Tu;Jonathan LeMoel;Daniel Wolozny;Henry Ma;Roberto Passaro;Kristin Boulier	None	None	BBa_K363000	BBa_K363999

Detecting these heavy metals is an important task. So we designed a heavy-metal-detecting E. coli. In order to design the system, we employed two fluorescence proteins (GFP, RFP) and aryl acylamidase as signal reporters. The aryl acylamidase converts a colorless acetaminophen(Tylenol TM) to a brown color substrate. Since the detecting E. coli has three heavy metal promoters, if more than two heavy metals coexist in a solution, the E. coli emit mixed fluorescence, so we simultaneously detect metals. Our goal is to synthetic modules put these three genes for different heavy metals in a row in E. coli and then utilized in the form of a lyophilized powder, which can be stored in a drug capsule to make it portable so that analysis of water is easily processed.

For controlling cell death, we designed 'Lysisbox' consists of a pair of modules: 'Killer gene' and 'Anti-killer gene.' As the Killer gene for E.coli, we noted the lysis cassette [SRRz/Rz1gene] of lambda phage coding for a holin and an endolysin. The holin forms pores in the inner membrane, and the endolysin access to and degrade the peptidoglycan by passing through the pores, leading the E.coli to death. As the Anti-killer gene, we chose S-TMD1 coding for a dominant-negative holin that inhibits the formation of the fatal pores. The balance of these two genes expression level has a key of the E.Coli's life or death. In addition, such controllable membrane pores must show critical functions for all living organisms with lipid membranes.

We are targeting catechol for degradation into common metabolic intermediates of the Krebs Cycle by using xylE from Pseudomonas putida that codes for the protein catechol-2,3-dioxygenase.  Catechol-2,3-dioxygenase is being targeted into microcompartments, formed by engineered Aquifex aeolicus protein, lumazine synthase, to reduce cross-talk and increase concentration.  The complex will then be purified and applied to the tailings for catechol degradation.  By funnelling other pathways through catechol we can develop efficient methods for the decontamination of the tailings ponds.  Mms6 from Magnetospirillum magneticum removes heavy metals from solution by forming nanoparticles.  The Mms6 protein will be secreted from the cell into the tailings for the removal of metals such as iron and cobalt for creating an efficient bioremediation process.

These crystal proteins are toxic to certain types of mosquitoes and are not pathogenic to mammals.

One, we want our highlight to be the first team to provide the iGEM registry with stress-inducible promoters to be used in plants. These promoters can be valuable tools in monitoring the environment for salt, heavy metals, temperature, and more. Second, we want to develop a real-time monitoring model of these stress-inducible promoters by having fluorescent reporters linked to their expression. Current research typically uses microarray, a technique that takes a 'snapshot' of a system, where as we want to hold a 'video camera' up to specific genes. Third, we will show the advantages of using Nicotiana tabacum protoplasts (NT cells). Our NT cell system provides a faster, cheaper, and safer method of obtaining a transgenic plant model than transforming an actual plant, benefits future iGEM teams may want to take into consideration.

BacillaFilla would be applied to structures by spraying onto their surface. The Bacillus swims deep into the microcracks. Repair is effected by production of CaCO3, filamentous cells and Levansucrose. CaCO3 expands at the same rate as concrete, making it the ideal filler. A filamentous cell mesh provides reinforcement. Levansucrose glues CaCO3 and filamentous cells in place. B. subtilis 168 sporulates, making it ideal for storage and transportation. The cells are naturally tolerant to concrete's high pH. We repaired 168's defective swrA and sfp, regaining motility. At the end of the crack the quorum communication peptide subtilin triggers a co-ordinated population response from a subtilin-inducible promoter. Upregulating SR1 and rocF promotes arginine and urea production, increasing exogenous  CaCO3 deposition. Over-producing  yneA induces  the filamentous cell phenotype, while SacB converts extracellular sucrose to levansucrose glue.	naw3	Anil Wipat	None	None	njsh2	Jennifer Hallinan	None	None	shethharsh08;Daye;swoodhouse;jannetta;RachelBoyd;alankoh;Yessa;PhilipHall;deenatsu	Harsh Jayesh Sheth;Da Ye;Steven Woodhouse;Jannetta Steyn;Rachel May Boyd;Alan Koh;Younus Essa;Philip Hall;Deena Tsu	stachopeter;matthew.pocock;wendysmith	Jem Stach;Matthew Pocock;Wendy Smith	BBa_K302000	BBa_K302999

Like keratin in skin, it comprises the protective outer layer of these animals. Our chitin expression platform involves generating a layer of chitin from a lawn of bacteria in response to an external molecular cue. This cue induces chitin synthesis (fast) and cell lysis (slow). This system allows for a build-up of chitin followed by cell lysis and subsequent release into the top layer of the lawn. Abrasions expose cells to the external cue for self-repair. In this way, we create a regenerative chitin biolayer with potential medical and industrial applications.

Our goal is to speed up the reporting response of bacterial gene expression through shortening the time needed for routine iGEM experiments. We intend to construct systems aimed at reducing experimental time and increasing efficiency of construction production. To achieve the goal, our design process is split up into three parts: Riboswitch, mRNA Binding, and SsrA. (1) Riboswitch - faster production of proteins by inducing the translation of pre-transcribed RNA molecules. (2) mRNA Binding - using mRNA aptamers and split GFP/RFP-eIF4A reporter systems to show faster promoter activity or the expression of mRNA transcripts. (3) SsrA - fast, specific, and constitutive proteolysis achieved by engineering fluorescent proteins with LVA tags.	nymuchang	Chuan-Hsiung Chang	None	None	Smoox	Chien-Tsun Chen	None	None	z2567989;v225522;erich060;igemget1;sy103179;ltd2001;bl7wh;bjobjo;k45204113;yohoho;nobloodwar;hiiamlala;Lucy;littlebow;Tomny;Brace;waken;duncan6502;Jessey;clint;barry50710;NickLai;inconnuspigeon;bigwolf;YPJ;SyueLiang;yutong	Chun-Hao Hsieh;Po-Hsiang Liao;Eric Po-Yu Huang;Zong Min Lin;Yu - Ju Chen;Yi-Fan Chen;Shih-Ying Wang;Heng-Jai Liu;Yong-Yu, Jhan;Chien-Tzu Tseng;Geng Ming Su;Yen-Chen Lin;Chia-Hua Ho;Po-chin Wu;HUNG, YU-SHENG;Yun-Ting Shih;Chuan-Sin Wu;Cheng-Ting Lin;chien-jung Guo;KO KUEI YUEH;Po-Yu Chen;CHUN-YU LAI;JO-YU FENG;Ying Hsien Lee;Ping-Ju You;Syue Liang , Lin;Tan Shun Yu	eyelight;LFYeh;blackrabbit	Yen-Kuang Chen;Li Feng Yeh;Jesse Wu	BBa_K411000	BBa_K411999

Rhamnolipids as biosurfactants are important in the remediation of oil spill areas. The cleanup of the Exxon Valdez oil spill using rhamnolipids as biosurfactants was too expensive and complicated, therefore impractical for large-scale bioremediation. However, with advances genetic engineering and synthetic biology offer a viable solution to oil spill pollution clean up. In this project we use genetic engineering as a tool to integrate genetic parts through the BioBrick assembly standard protocol of iGEM to develop a BioBrick for rhamnosiltransferase 1 complex (rhlAB) gene expression in Escherichia coli for standardized rhamnolipid production. Our BioBrick integrates a promoter, a RBS (ribosomal binding site), our part rh1AB gene sequence isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a GFP reporter and a terminator. All the parts fit into a plasmid backbone that can be transformed into E. coli strains, which can then produce rhamnolipids.

Past attempts at developing counters in cells have mostly attempted to mimic the binary methods that computers use to count.Our first counter takes a new approach to counting in cells, essentially a mechanical rotary counter implemented on a micro scale.  Each time the counter detects an input, it performs an excision and integration directly down-stream of the active site, turning on a reporter and rotating over one 'notch' on the counter.Our second counter operates on the wholly different principle that the statistical occurrence of a rare event in a large population can be modeled.  Each cell in our population harbors a construct that when stimulated has a small chance of excising a terminator and expressing a resistance gene.  The number of resistant cells is thus an accurate count of the number of input stimuli.	ablindner	Ariel Lindner	None	None	YangYifan;ericmeltzer	Yang Yifan;Eric Meltzer	None	None	adecrulle;Aleksandra;xduportet;StephP;arichard;rpantier;theotime;Léadixon	Antoine Decrulle;Aleksandra Nivina;Xavier Duportet;Stéphane PINHAL;Alexandre Richard;Raphael Pantier;Théotime Calandra;Léa Dixon	david.bikard;ascoquel;tlombes	David Bikard;coquel anne-sophie;Thomas Lombes	BBa_K329000	BBa_K329999

First of all, we analyzed the function, structure and operation of the transcription factor MerR, a mercury-responsive regulator in detail via bioware experiments and modeling. Then appropriate topology candidates for proper bioreporters were carefully searched. We selected a candidate and re-designed genetic components to accomplish certain bioreporter function in need, which was verified by following bioware experiments. For bioabsorbents, we engineered MerR into a metal binding peptide. This was followed by inductive expression of engineered peptide on surface, periplasm and cytosol of E.coli. This reverse engineering method was then expanded to lead-responsive regulator, PbrR, to confirm the validness of this method. Results demonstrated that the procedure mentioned above is streamlined enough to construct valid whole-cell bioreporters and bioabsorbents of various heavy metals for field application in the near future.	qiPku	Qi Ouyang	None	None	None	None	None	None	May;lgdeer;Eastsea;Crystal;JjunyiJiao;xteng;Spring_zhq;wqz;starshine;Cathterry;evamonlight;Huyang;DragonKnight;Simenhomer;kitties;Nancy;Joo;miaoconfectioner0314	Mei Chen;Lu Yuheng;Donghai Liang;Ao Liu;Junyi Jiao;Xin Teng;Haoqian Zhang;Qianzhu Wu;miao jing;Weiye Wang;Zhenzhen Yin;Yang Hu;Heng Pan;Boxuan Zhao;Ying Sheng;Zairan Liu;Zhu Tianze;Yiwei Chen	None	None	BBa_K346000	BBa_K346999

To monitor these processes we created and oxygen bio-sensor in E. coli which produces an anaerobic fluorescent protein.  The task of creating an oxygen bio-sensor is compounded by the fact that oxygen diffusion through many substances is very limited; so oxygen contamination can be undetected due to a response which is too 'soft' . To combat this, we enabled our sensor to induce this response in non-oxygenated bacteria via the lux system; thus amplifying the signal and producing a bio-alarm which is sufficiently 'loud' to not be missed.  To accomplish this goal we characterized the response characteristics of the many different Lux components in the parts-distribution.

We proposed two synthetic-biological approaches to OA, one with a eukaryotic genetic circuit and another prokaryotic. Both circuits are composed of three systems: 'Detector', 'Actuator' and 'Supervisor'. As for Detector, we built tissue-specific promoters in the eukaryotic circuit, while inflammation factors are employed as signals of OA in the prokaryotic circuit. The same Actuator shared by two circuits generates proteins col2a1, which replenishes the degraded matrix, and oct4, which reverses the disordered differentiation. The eukaryotic Supervisor part has an original design in which a photo-sensitive cation channel crosstalks with certain cellular signaling pathways, resulting in the light-controlled expression of col2a1 and oct4; in the counterpart of prokaryotic circuit, both injected inducers and over-population lead the engineered bacteria to suicide, thus attenuating possible side effects.	helin	Lin He	None	None	magang	Gang Ma	None	None	Anything;biohyp;rosalyn;AmandaZhao;kaidou;amarantine;Latte;k_omobomax;cindyxwd;Dennis*C;PatrickH.C.;liuyuanbird;menglong;foreverycc;chenlibin	Zhe Shen;He Yupeng;Yueling Zhou;Qing Zhao;Chuan Shan;Yue Duan;Chen Ma;Shengdi Li;Wendi Xu;Han Zhu;Chen Huang;Yuan Liu;Menglong Zeng;Chenchen Yang;Libin Chen	None	None	BBa_K387000	BBa_K387999

However, many important biological processes are governed by the ratio between the concentrations of multiple chemicals. To create systems capable of responding to more complex input data, the Stanford team designed two types of ratio-measuring sensors. The first sensor utilizes two unique small RNAs to inhibit the transcription of two operons, each responding to an environmental factor and having a specific flourescent protein (or output gene). By manipulating the number of small RNAs produced, a tipping point between outputs can be established for different input ratios. The second sensor uses a phosphorylatable protein to control the transcription rate of an output promoter. By linearly associating two chemical inputs to the production of a kinase and a phosphatase, the ratio of the two environmental factors indirectly dictates the activity of the output promoter.	drew	Drew Endy	None	None	csmolke	Christina Smolke	None	None	axva1663;cbrunson;ocsicnarf;karpadillo;GregOwen	Alejandro Virrueta;Christopher Brunson;Francisco Cai;Karina Padilla;Gregory Owen	chrisvanlang;isist;anshurama;drummstikk;alc;rayka;rjbloom;stpierre	Christopher C VanLang;Isis Trenchard;Anusuya Ramasubramanian;Graham A.

We have focused on vitiligo in where pigment cells are destroyed, resulting in white patches on the skin. Studies have shown that vitiligo patients have decreased levels of antioxidants and elevated levels of antibodies targeting the pigment cells in the skin. We have used synthetic biology to fuse cell-penetrating peptides to proteins that are deficient in skin of vitiligo patients. The cell-penetrating peptides will aid in passing the proteins through the skin and target the pigment cells to reach repigmentation. Currently there are no treatments like ours for vitiligo patients. However, we strongly believe that synthetic biology can help bacteriotherapy getting a major role in fighting several skin disorders in the future, and that our first explorations in this field inspires others to continue exploring.

To lessen its metabolic burden, the system should respond to low concentrations of autoinducer produced by V. cholerae and co-ordinate this response using the Lux quorum-sensing system. We have explored rearranging the network architecture of the Lux system to give bistable expression. A model to describe bistability was formed using ODEs and implemented in C++. To assess the perception of synthetic biology, software was written to gather data from social networking and news sites and quantify the change in opinions with time.	vannesmith	V Anne Smith	None	None	pythonhat;olipops;jbom;hooley	Wim Verleyen;Olivia Mendivil Ramos;John Mitchell;Chris Hooley	None	None	fsalimi;L7ukas;JWTaylor;RachaelBlackburn;Ally_m;D;patrickolden;jaunty;SarahS	Fatemeh Salimi;Lukas Ly;James Ward Taylor;Rachael Blackburn;Alasdair Morton;C David Owen;Patrick Olden;Jonathan Ward;Sarah Shapiro	Oli	Olivia Mendivil Ramos	BBa_K356000	BBa_K356999

The first bacterial reporters appeared 20 years ago, although these early tests didn't use genetically modified microorganisms. Further research and development in the area of genetic engineering has resulted in newer and more sophisticated bacterial sensors, capable of detecting the presence of contaminants, sugars and amino acids in different media such as soil and water. However, most bacterial sensors can only detect the presence of a compound at a certain concentration and currently there are few documented bacterial sensors that can detect and report different concentrations of the compound of interest. Our objective was to develop a genetic frame, compatible with the BioBrick standard, for the creation of a concentration-sensitive bacterial sensor. In the process we also developed and characterized BioBricks for two new families of phage activators.

The EcoTanker takes up a target compound from the environment and delivers it to a desired location for easy harvesting. The target compound is taken up and stored inside the cell in an EcoTank, a bacterial microcompartment (pduABJKNU). Blue light then directs the delivery of the 'cargo' to a desired destination by phototaxis, using the N. pharaonis blue light responsive domain (NpSRII-NpHtrII-Tar) linked to an E. coli two component system. The EcoTankers are then signaled by green light to self-aggregate and autolyse in response to quorum sensing. We can then easily collect the EcoTanks filled with the target compound, which could be an environmentally toxic substance or an industrially desirable chemical. We expect that EcoTanker to be a powerful machine in various bioremediation and industrial applications.	stef	Stefano Ferri	None	None	japanssun;Kamome;TUKA;abekou;Aptaman	Jihoon Kim;Yoshihiko NONAKA;Kaori TSUKAKOSHI;Koichi Abe;Kazunori IKEBUKURO	None	None	Nasa;maia;Yuta;fukaya;Yoshiyuki;taiki;Aki;Atsuro;Rei;Yasuhiko;hira;Youhei;Tomohiko;sachiko;yosuke;KenZ;nakaji;Naga	Nasa SAVORY;Maia Inoue;Yuta Sakai;Takahiro Fukaya;Yoshiyuki MURAKAMI;Taiki Saito;Aki Kezuka;Atsuro Tatsumi;Rei Toda;Yasuhiko SASAKI;Daisuke HIRAOKA;Youhei Horaguchi;Tomoihko oshige;sachiko ANDO;Yosuke Onishi;Kenji Kakubori;Mitsuharu Nakajima;Daichi NAGAE	MahiMahi	Koji Sode	BBa_K317000	BBa_K317999

Firstly, two cells have different types of antibiotic-resistance, however this expression is repressed in absence of outer stimulation. Two factors of stimulation, cell density and light, are required at once to activate the antibiotic resistance. We took advantage of photoregulation system (Cph1-EnvZ) to make sure downstream promoter is activated with light. This promoter is followed by circuit designed to sense the cell density of its counterpart and activate the counterpart cell's antibiotic-resistant gene.

However, extracting the hydrocarbons requires large volumes of water which are then contaminated with naphthenic acids, heavy metals and residual hydrocarbons.  These 'tailings' are acutely toxic to higher organisms, though some bacteria and algae can survive in these environs.  Our knowledge of metabolic pathways capable of degrading such contaminants (bioremediation) is limited.  However, the known pathways tend to be slow and inefficient.  The breakdown of many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons generates a common intermediate, catechol that is further degraded to Acetyl-CoA.  Metabolic channeling is an effect whereby intermediates are shuttled between enzymes in a pathway circumventing free diffusion into the cytosol.  Here, we present a design, modeling and baseline experiments aimed at demonstrating optimization of catechol degradation using the principle of metabolic channeling in an E. coli proof of concept system.	gcromar	Graham Cromar	None	None	disable1987;aminzia	Kris Hon;Amin Zia	None	None	akapadia;FR;Elena_P;mmmyan;dragonyen19	Anish Kapadia;Farhan;Elena Pasko;Mengyan Li;Yen Leung	K.Zhan;ddewong;Stacy Hung;jparkin	Kenny Zhan;Daniel Wong;Stacy Hung;John Parkinson	BBa_K357000	BBa_K357999

Biopharmaceuticals are commonly synthesized using E. coli as production chassis.

The UCL iGEM team aims to create 'independent' cells in which the production phase is triggered by an external stimulus, removing the need for IPTG.  The stationary phase growth in bioreactors is preceded by a dip in dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) followed by a DOT spike. We have developed a genetic circuit in which a series of promoters will cause the production to be triggered by the hypoxic condition. This auto-induction promises an economically and manufacturing improved production of biopharmaceuticals. There is the potential of applying this 'Pavlovian' circuit principle in near future to yeast, mammalian or other expression systems for the production of complex biomolecules for the treatment of major diseases.	ucbekkm	Eli Keshavarz-Moore	None	None	DNesbeth	Darren Nesbeth	None	None	davinat;zcbcd06;zcbee12;Memecy;jameswbrown;dbrindley;v.raszler;elenapal;a.abed;ali.albazergan;davidbennett;cmoujaes3;cmoujaes	Natasha Davie;Xiang Chen;Omar El Saidi;Mariam Awlia;James Brown;Dave Brindley;Veronika Raszler;Elena Pallari;Arif Abed;Ali-Albazergan Ali;david bennett;Carolina  Moujaes;Carolina Moujaes	None	None	BBa_K301000	BBa_K301999

Regardless of their scope, these messengers are constrained to a system; eg: even far reaching couriers such as hormones are bound within the chemical structure that is the human body. But this is about to change. In this project, our goal is to render the chemical barrier deprecated by using a non-chemical herald: photons. These will transport information between our engineered cells, creating a photon-based inter-cellular communication system. These messengers are produced through bio-luminescent reactions, and are quite capable of traversing multiple environments. This enables the transmission of information beyond the chemical, biological, and even spatial limitations. As the courier is effectively decoupled from the chemical layer, it is an innovative step in establishing communications between organic-based and silicon-based systems, such as computers.

The production  process still has several drawbacks affecting cost/efficiency. In this work, three modular systems were designed to overcome some of these bottlenecks. A library of self-inducible promoters was built and characterized to start the peptide production at a desired culture density, without expensive inducer molecules. Two standard integrative vectors were realized to insert BioBrick parts in user-defined positions of E. coli or S. cerevisiae genome, to ensure genetic stability without using selection markers. Finally, two promising techniques were combined for an 'in-cell' protein purification: PolyHydroxyAlkanoate (PHA) granules were used as a substrate for PHA-binding peptides (Phasins) fused to the target protein, thus replacing affinity resins/columns and tags, while a pH-based self-cleaving peptide (Intein) was used instead of a protease cleavage site. These solutions are modular and provide useful BioBrick parts for other applications.	magni	Paolo Magni	None	None	Cusella	Cusella Gabriella	None	None	Neuro;baren;Chiara;manu.zocco;nickpv;sara2010;fedesampi	Alessandro Ranieri;Riccardo Barini;Chiara Tassorelli;Manuel Zocco;Nicolò Politi;Sara Bisi;Federica Sampietro	lor18;Susanna;Manuel7d9;Matteo;110hs	Lorenzo Pasotti;Susanna Zucca;Manuel Lupotto;Matteo Meroso;Giacomo Zambianchi	BBa_K300000	BBa_K300999

We aim to solve this issue by contributing a library of well-characterized yeast toggle switch components with varying dynamics. In order to characterize these switches, each of the two repressors, driven by mutually repressible promoters, is tagged with a distinct fluorescent protein that can be detected and quantified using flow cytometry. To expand the BioBrick database we will submit functionally-tested yeast-enhanced fluorescent proteins, repressors, and a library of repressible promoters. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of these components in fine tuning genetic networks, we hope to use these toggle switches to build a DNA damage sensor with varying levels of sensitivity. We also describe novel methods for BioBrick construction based on natural homologous recombination mechanisms in S. cerevisiae.	mkaern	Mads Kaern	None	None	None	None	None	None	aazizi;morto077;Justoutofhighschool;csun098;ceule085@uottawa.ca;radizinoviev;mlynn55;djedrysiak	Afnan Azizi;Matthew Orton;Samantha Graitson;Candyce Sun;Chris Euler;Radi Zinoviev;Michael Lynn;Daniel Jedrysiak	None	None	BBa_K319000	BBa_K319999

However, since in most cases bacteria are not drawn towards their targets, the possibility of specific interaction is limited to those bacterial cells that randomly collide with the surface, thus requiring a high bacterial population to achieve efficient targeting. On the other hand, most bacteria are specifically attracted by gradients of a variety of chemicals, thus achieving high cell densities in the areas where the chemoattractants are present at higher concentration. The aim of 'Bacterial Crowding' is to exploit chemotaxis for directing a relatively small population of bacteria to interact efficiently with a non-diffusible target exposed on a biotic or abiotic surface.	fgovrom	Fernando Govantes	None	None	lmercab	Luis Merino	None	None	Freymar;Adrian;efercac;Paola;dcabpra;lepavgom	Félix Reyes Martín;Adrián Arellano Davín;Eva Fernández Cáceres;Paola Gallardo;David Caballero;Luis Eduardo Pavón Gómez	None	None	BBa_K367000	BBa_K367999

We designed a set of concentration detectors that measures different range of the input signal and respond only to a specific concentration interval. By combining and spatio-temporal coordinating such concentration detectors we attempt to construct a biological clock that display time. The concentration band components themselves would work as a quantitative sensor that can work in combination other chemical sensors, such as toxic metals to life saving enzymes, which previous iGEM teams have come up with. Apart from this utility, we believe the concentration band detect sensor in different configurations can allow the creation of complex circuits ranging from simple oscillators to complex data processing machines which can exist on the same system without affecting other components of the system owing to its concentration band specificity.

Thus we design, model and construct a platform for artificial organelles. The shell genes of Citrobacter freundii pdu bacterial microcompartment (BMC) were first constructed into BioBrick parts, assembled and expressed to form an empty porous multi-protein shell of ~100nm. Then target protein can be located either inside or outside the empty shell by fusing the protein with signal sequences, using a novel and convenient assembly standard compatible with the RFC 10. Onto this platform, artificial organelles with different functions can be constructed. With enzymes or binding proteins inside the shell, different nanoreactors or nanoreservoirs can be produced. Modifications outside the shell can be applied to build multi-protein super-complexes or facilitate downstream purification with affinity tags.

However, the successful assembly of organisms that integrate multiple (>3) pieces of information into an elongated AND gate has yet to be seen. Our '4C3 leak-switch' realizes such a tool with the use of homologous recombination and leaky transcriptional terminators. This switch turns on only when three of four types of information are transmitted, regardless of the order of transmission, and outputs differently depending on the combinations of input. Our current project aims at creating bacteria that collectively solve the popular puzzle game Sudoku. This aim is achieved by combining this switch with our second subproject, the 'signal-virus,' which relays information only to the relevant targets, based on an antisense-RNA key system. This system realizes parallel-computing and we believe will greatly advance the field of information-processing.

Upon transformation into Synechocystis, it integrates the device directly into the genome through homologous recombination. We utilized genes that were activated under a variety of conditions, from those responding to heat stress to ones oscillating under a circadian rhythm.

The proposal is that dark yeast cells retain the arriving radiation and heat the surface. But, once the temperature reaches its optimum on the planetary surface the color production should be switched off. In order to achieve that and taking advantage of Synthetic Biology principles, a switch based on prion proteins (on mad yeast!) will be used. The work will be complemented with the implementation of the expression of  LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) 'antifreeze' protein.

This project demonstrates these capabilities through experimentation and modeling.  Another candidate for reapplying an electronic engineering technique is the codesign of hardware and software to implement a function.   In synthetic biology, codesign might mean implementing a design spec in different expression control regimes and comparing their relative merits.  Our work examines the codesign concept by constructing an AND gate in three different design domains.  We explore the application of these ideas with an environmental sensor.

Invasin causes uptake of the bacterium into the mammalian cell by induction of endocytosis. Bacterial cells are lysed in the endosome and then LLO is released. LLO is a pore-forming toxin which causes endosomal membrane disruption and release of the payload (either protein or DNA) into cytoplasm of the mammalian cell. In order to fine-tune expression of genes used in our project we conducted measurement of various RBS parts included in 2010 spring distribution both from Community and Anderson's collections.

In this project, the concept of a whole-cell biosensor has been adapted for medical use as a diagnostic for viral infection through engineering a commensal bacterium. Lactobacilli are the predominant commensal organisms in the human vaginal mucosa and are ideally placed to detect the presence of a sexually transmitted infection, such as Human Papillomavirus. A strain of this bacterium has been modified to produce a chromogenic reporter, which is visible to the naked eye, when 'switched on' through exposure to the input signal (viral infection). However, in order for this to be clearly visible in vivo, this signal needs to be transmitted throughout the entire bacterial population. Thus, this project focused on a) modifying a Gram-positive bacterium to produce the chromogenic reporter; b) using a heterologous quorum-sensing mechanism to propagate an auto-regulated feedback loop amongst a bacterial population.	rsparrow	Raymond Sparrow	None	None	rumbold;madigoem;Marco_Weinberg;RobertKowalenko	Karl Rumbold;Ezekiel Madigoe;Marco Weinberg;Robert Kowalenko	None	None	ByronJacobs;Chelle;Liam_Wilson;Langa;Greg_M;Shaun_Burd	Byron Jacobs;Michelle Robinson;Liam Wilson;Langelihle Ntloko;Gregory Meyer;Shaun Christopher Burd	LauraMillroy;Youtaro;RobynB	Laura Millroy;Youtaro Shibayama;Robyn Brackin	BBa_K354000	BBa_K354999

We first built a mathematical model to quantitatively predict RIPS (ribosome initiation per sec) of any given coding sequence in any organism. We then constructed three modules (synonymous substitution, optimization and RIPS design) to process input coding sequences. Bach could recompose the input sequence into an output one that better suits the host organism and performs the specific translational rate of desire. In this way, the discordant tunes of codon bias in biobricks from different genetic backgrounds could be synchronized, and the realization of a more predictable and robust system would be possible. Our work not only benefits current works involving exogenous protein expression, but also makes a big step towards standardization and characterization of biobricks.	mingchen	Ming Chen	None	None	wumin	wu min	None	None	demonfool;sherryweihao;JiaLi;SirGreedy;wilson;goodboy;WendyHu;ju.mekey;Thorondor;huayijie;tyotakuki;robertying;andrewpal;wenchao;fatestudio;Mercury;supersally;Leo.M;Edward;Vincere	ZHU Kan;Wei Hao;Jia Li;LI Ye;ZHAO Cong;Yang Haocheng;HU Chenyue;Mimi Zhu;JING ZHAO;Hua Yijie;ZHANG Zhuohui;Guoyuan Ying;Shaohua Wang;Song Wenchao;Zhou Qin;ZHAO Junjie;Li Yao;Ma Lie;Cui Yunpeng;Xia Yu	yinggangyan	Yinggang Yan	BBa_K402000	BBa_K402999

This kind of mechanism provides a nearly real-time control over genes, which could provide advantages in variety of industrial bioprocesses.    Inspired by the principles of open source software, we introduce an Open Sequence business model implemented around our switch. We want to encourage future companies to create Open Sequence based solutions and to empower customers to participate in the product development. Open Sequence model’s transparency as well as lower degree of protection raises trust and continuity and benefits larger community.

As the coffee berries are digested, bitter components of the coffee bean are broken down. Later, the beans are cleaned, roasted, and brewed to make the Kopi Luwak coffee.  The problem with the procedure today is that farming industries keeps tens of thousands of civets living in battery cages, and force-feeds them only coffee berries. As a result of the treatment, the Asian Palm Civet population is declining.  We propose to make this process humane, efficient, and sanitary by instead using bacteria to produce the coffee. We will accomplish this by genetically engineering E. coli with genes for various digestive enzymes, thus simulating the digestive process of the civets with coffee berries so we can finally save the Asian Palm Civets.	amathieu	Aaron Mathieu	None	None	None	None	None	None	17kapoora;15kuffnerc;17malim;15pervierb;16joism;16yaow;17taussigc;16jawahart;barryhuang123;iGem5S;17liuk;Bstern15;15hongj;16huangw;VChen;anushapurakayastha;16sahoor	Akash Kapoor;Chris Kuffner;Mayank Mali;Benjamin Pervier;Madhuri Jois;Wynne Yao;Charles Taussig;Tara Jawahar;Barry Huang;Rachel Tao;Katherine Liu;Ben Stern;Justin Hong;William Huang;Victoria Chen;Anusha Purakayastha;Roshni Sahoo	None	None	BBa_K1261000	BBa_K1261999

Using a wax esterase, fatty acids and ethanol, both naturally produced by E. coli, can be combined to form biodiesel. However, E. coli uses the same intermediate products to produce both fatty acids and ethanol, which reduces the efficiency of this process. This problem can be avoided by engineering two different strains of E. coli to work in tandem. One strain will be engineered to produce free fatty acids (FFA) through expression of enzymes including as TesA and acc. The other strain will be engineered to produce ethanol through expression of enzymes including pdc and adhB. These two products will be combined in one of the two cells using a waxy esterase, producing the final biodiesel product. Cooperative production will hopefully produce more ethanol than current single strain methods using E. coli.	kahaynes	Karmella Haynes	None	None	xiaowang;nielsendr	Xiao Wang;David Nielsen	None	None	mykema;stashmore94;vsomayaj;sirbedevire;mgwaddin	Matthew Ykema;Scott Ashmore;Vallari Somayaji;David Reynolds;Michael Waddington	ksstanda;Rene.Davis	Kylie Standage-Beier;Rene M.

This objective has created a network of open-ponds for algae production, dispersed across the southwest of the United States. As synthetic biology moves out of the lab into the wild, what are the ecological effects associated with the release of a modified organism?    Car Pools is a series of simulations that examine potential ecological effects associated with the public release of modified algae for biofuel production. The project draws on current open-pond algae production methods to imagine a future fuel-pool infrastructure for Los Angeles, a metropolis built for cars and where there are more than 43,000 swimming pools.

Up to now, the number one cause of death worldwide is caused by ischemia and related conditions such as heart attack or stroke. It is needed to regard the big picture of the condition in order to solve the problem. In our project, our will is to build two different devices, which work synergistically, to fix these two distinct situations. We decided to use ‘’hypoxia inducible systems” and ‘’reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensitive gene fragments’’.

Typically, expansion occurs via reassignment of the amber stop codon.  When reassigned, this codon results in incorporation of a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) not normally found in proteins.  Such ncAAs can grant new functionality, including photocrosslinking, photocaging, novel bonding or binding sites, and fluorescence.  One part of our project creates an “Expansion Pack Reporter Kit”.  This kit uses a fused fluorescent reporter, containing an N-terminal RFP domain, a C-terminal GFP domain, and an amber codon-containing linker sequence that connects the two domains.  While the RFP domain is translated and fluoresces under all conditions, the GFP domain is only translated when the ncAA is incorporated within the linker.  Failure to incorporate the ncAA leads to translation termination, and thus no GFP fluorescence.  This allows us to accurately assess the rate and fidelity of ncAA incorporation.	jbarrick	Jeffrey Barrick	None	None	Zen_Blade	Dennis Mishler	None	None	jordanmonk;katemortensen;nathanshin;Ew6977;algutz	Jordan Monk;Catherine Mortensen;Nathan Shin;Ella Watkins;Alejandro Gutierrez	mhammerling	Michael Hammerling	BBa_K1416000	BBa_K1416999

A seemingly simple and non-invasive mechanism for this remote control is the use of magnetic fields.  By altering the iron homeostasis of E. coli, we want to increase the total iron level of the cytosol. By sequestering iron in a ferritin protein, iron crystals are formed and the cell is detoxified.   We will work with other metal binding proteins such as metallothioneins and phytochelatin synthases in order to create ferromagnetic crystals. Furthermore, we will search for the optimal conditions which yield the most efficient formation of magnetic nanoparticles in E. coli. Once we have discovered the best way to magnetize E. coli bacteria, we will build and characterize suitable BioBricks that can be used to remote control the cellular movement of E. coli.

Astronauts have been sent to outer space. In the meantime, how to prevent radiation harm has become a serious problem that demands promting solution.  Our project focuses on establishing a more portable, accurate and economical biosynthetic system to detect the dosage, and to provide measurement precisely to guard human from being hurt by invisible radiation. We assembly gene circuits in E.coli, which function as radiation detector and reporter individually. Meanwhile, we design bi-switch circuits for the detector, a quorum sensing circuits for reporter and a linkage between the two. Once the detector senses radiation by the damage, the linkage auto-inducer molecules will drive the reporter to produce light and digital signals.  We firmly believe that this biological-activity-based detector system is more sensitive, and has more significant influence in measuring the level of harm by sensing the dosage of radiation.	qinghong1	Hong Qing	None	None	yifeiwang;hongma;XuefeilLv	Yifei Wang;Hong Ma;Xuefei Lv	None	None	CharMoon;YeChen;manchester;NanZhang;Flair;YJQiu;Dongya111;MengDiYao;AlecWang;liangxi627;xiaolu;Cait.z;leomuch;domingo;sherly;Biowhat;DayanZhang;xieyujie;stoneSYJ;Tuphie;Xiaojuan;liubianshi;belief_yijie;Junya	Zhang Deyu;Ye Chen;Da Song;Nan Zhang;Yunlong Fan;Yunjie Qiu;Dongya Hou;MengDi Yao;Wang Pengju;Xi Liang;Pan Lu;Yimin Tan;Maoqi Liu;XingJian Zhang;YinTong Chen;Di Peng;Dayan Zhang;Yujie Xie;Yuanjie Shi;Yifei Lee;Xiaojuan Cai;chunxia qin;Jie Yi;Junya Wu	lkf1013;RunhongRay;qinkuiwei;Yiming_Dong	Liu Kefu;Runhong Lei;Qin Kuiwei;Yiming Dong	BBa_K1407000	BBa_K1407999

This bio-lock, likened to a digital combination lock, allows bacteria to grow only if three different inducers as password is put in order. To realize the code function three layered AND logic gates combined with sRNA system are built up. The corresponding sRNA selectively inhibits gene expression in AND gates to control the order of the password. MIN system is re-designed to inhibit cell division, which will be turned on to maintain the strain to a low density. In a word, locked bacteria are allowed to grow only when the input is correct; thus strains would remain low density and are effectively locked up. Therefore, commercially valuable or potentially hazardous strains will be under more strict control with different customized E.co-Locks.	bitlichun	Chun Li	None	None	JasperCity;bitguosy	Jun Li;Shuyuan Guo	None	None	JiangNS;JIAhaiyang;Strider;ztjbit;biotar;coffee528;Mengxin;yimi;WangYQ;Gaonan;ElPsyCongroo;Mingming;chongchong;allenJian;LiJinlinT.K.;Rambo;xbjmh;yujiazhao;houhuilongfei;EVA1992;YaHang;answey;491508976@qq.com	NiSi Jiang;JIA Haiyang;Baiyang Liu;Tengjiang Zhang;Chenyi Li;Ke Xu;Xin Meng;Huan sun;Yunqian Wang;Nan Gao;Zhong Wan;Mingming Cao;Wenxin Bai;Xing Jian;Jinlin Li;Zongzhi Lv;Bing Xiao;Yujia Zhao;Hui Hou;Luan Yinan;Hang Ya;Lei Siyu;Guanghua Qing	Genlin	Genlin Zhang	BBa_K1325000	BBa_K1325999

Absence of symptoms in early stages leads to a late diagnosis when patients need dialysis or even transplants. Currently, CKD is diagnosed by measuring creatinine levels in blood, which in turn are detectable only at late stages of renal dysfunction as well as are sensitive to factors such as diet, gender, ethnicity, age, muscle mass. We report the development of a biosensor that can diagnosis CKD in its early stages, identifying a biomarker named Cystatin C. Using a cell surface biosensor as detector and quorum-sensing system as transducer and response mechanism, we developed a genetic circuit that establishes a threshold, differentiating concentration ranges of Cystatin C.

Even though this is a natural process industrial-scale farming intensifies the situation. Therefore, finding ways to decrease production of such gases damaging to climate is essential. Considering the 25 times greater contribution to global warming compared to CO2, methane emission is a substantial point of action for future climate protection.  In order to achieve this, we are going to engineer a bacterium in a way  that it is able to render methane harmless just as it originates in the cow’s rumen. The bacterium shall be equipped with the 6 subunits of the monooxygenase (MMO) out of Methylococcus capsulatus turning methane into a natural intermediate of the cellular metabolism so that no methane is released into the atmosphere.

Estrogens from natural, synthetic, plant, and fungal sources show endocrine disrupting properties and even at low concentrations have harmful effects due to receptor activation. A sensor was constructed using the ligand binding domain of the human estrogen receptor. Estrogenic activity occurs in water sources including waste, drinking, and freshwater. In freshwater, estrogens are harmful to the ecosystems, feminizing fish and disrupting populations of organisms. Additionally, estrogenic substances can be present in what we drink. However, since the presence of hormones in water is a relatively new area of study there have been no previous restrictions or regulations regarding removal of estrogenic compounds. The sensor and fish ecosystems were modeled and middle school outreach kits for Creature Feature and DNA extraction and hybridization were created to demonstrate concepts of synthetic biology.	ctelmer	Cheryl Telmer	None	None	bruchez;natasa_mz	Marcel Bruchez;Natasa Miskov-Zivanov	None	None	nmatamala;dominiquecheylise;acelentano;lenaw;dopeters;nsundara;cpozzi	Nicole Matamala;Dominique MacCalla;Ali Celentano;Lena Wang;Danielle Peters;Niteesh Sundaram;Courtney Pozzi	dianam	Diana Marculescu	BBa_K1491000	BBa_K1491999

We construct E.coli to express RFP to draw a dynamic pattern of snowflake. Once we kindle a spot, the pattern starts and grows up gradually. According to our design, two kinds of E.coli with partly different genetic pathway align alternatively. The two kinds of E.coli interact through two independent quorum sensing systems, LuxI/LuxR/AHL in vibrio fischeri and RpaI/RpaR/pC-HSL in Rhodopseudomonas palustris, while neither of them influencing themselves. A plate for E.coli culture is divided into rectangular grids and every “cell” in the grid is occupied with a colon of E.coli. On-state shows as red fluorescence while off-state shows as nothing illuminating. To kindle the system, we only need to add correspondent signal molecular to the central 4 colons of E.coli in a plate. Finally, there will be a snowflake with red fluorescence starts to grow up from a point automatically.

Each year, the plant purchases 250,000 dollars worth of glycerin, which is used by bacteria to denitrify the water, in order to prevent eutrophication in the Chesapeake Bay. The UVa iGEM team from 2008 created a part which, when added, enables E.Coli to produce polyhydroxybutyrate, a biodegradable, bio-derived plastic. Our project is to make E.Coli that produces this plastic, which the plant could then use this bacteria to create polyhydroxybutyrate, filter out the E Coli, and then use the plastic as an alternative food source for their bacteria, saving them 250,000 dollars per year, as well as giving them a renewable energy source for their plant.

Capture module is in charge of recollecting sodium ions in the water due to the new NhaS gen registered by the team. Aroma module is with the help of salicylic acid, responsible of producing a Winter Green odor that acts as a reporter if the bio-filter is working. Resistance module allows the E. coli to survive in the salty environment of the water, and this allows the bio-filter to works. Finally, the Union module allow the bacterium to joins to a silica pearl, which facilitates the removal of the bacteria from the water.	jeannie05	Jannet Edith Salinas	None	None	hebersco	Heber Torres	None	None	DiegoValadez;ArnulfoAramis;amjg97;MQ;AngieMnL;jlhdza96;FernandaPuente;Jlouz;rapiman96;Piff;chuy_97;lisandro12;oda.ibarra;Marea;adrianrdz;UnicornioMagico;MelyChavez;Antonio09	Diego Ivan Valadez Lozano;Arnulfo Aramis Peña Torres;Andres Marcelo Jimenez Gonzalez;Eva Melissa Quintanar Sánchez;Angelina Griselda Miranda Lara;Jorge Luis Hernandez Ayala;Nancy Fernanda Puente Quintanilla;Joel Abdías Aguilar Orta;Raúl Jorge De La Garza Puente;Irina Romero Guerrero;Jesús Alberto Delgadillo Chapa;Lisandro Hiracheta Torres;Odalisse Carolina Ibarra Clemente;Marina Emilio Aguirre;Adrián Alejandro Rodríguez Rodríguez;Dulce María Valdez López;Ingrid Melissa Chávez de la Portilla;Antonio Cárdenas	lilycn4;ElsaYo;fvarela;maaracelia;manueltjr;Nash	Lilia Nallely Estrada Virrueta;Elsa Yolanda Flores Villa;Felix Alberto Varela Guillen;Maria Aracelia Alcorta García;Manuel Torres Barajas;Nashiely Moreira Vela	BBa_K1255000	BBa_K1255999

With the aim to protect oneself against obesity and debilitating diseases caused by a high-fat diet, we are using a synthetic biology approach to design an Escherichia coli strain (called Fit Coli) that has an enhanced ability to uptake and convert excess fatty acids from fatty foods into a-linolenic acid (ALA). The strategy is to engineer the fadL and fadD genes along with three desaturase genes to facilitate the uptake of long-chain fatty acids and their biotransformation to ALA by the “Fit Coli” strain. It is predicted that the ALA converted from excess fatty acids by Fit Coli is converted to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3-fatty acid, in the human gut, which is well known to have many positive health benefits.	bhrkong	Richard Y.C.

Decades of fire suppression have created large tracts of older pine forest that provide a highway for beetle expansion. The lack of fire, combined with a recent warming trend, means that the beetles are now occurring farther east, farther north and at higher elevations than ever before. This is cause for concern as the mountain national parks form the margin between the beetle outbreak in British Columbia and commercial forests in Alberta.    Our project will focus on building a bacterial plasmid that will produce and secrete the chitinase enzyme which will in turn be able to break down the chitin rich membranes of the BSF while leaving the tree unaffected and thus able to use its own defences to deal with the mountain pine beetle.

Starting with the goal of making microalgae an easier to engineer chassis, we set out to create a specialised toolkit of standardised biological parts. We strove to characterise a complete range of microalgal parts, including promoters, terminators, fluorescent proteins, localisation tags, antibiotic markers, and CRISPR/Cas. The diverse group of species we used included four distinct Chlorella spp. and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. These species display a broad range of growth conditions and metabolic profiles. With the creation of standardised tools for the stable engineering of microalgae, the community will be able to continue asking deeper questions about basic biology and, drastically increase the promise of microalgae as industrial hosts.	kharma	Nawwaf Kharma	None	None	wiltshir;alexjcampbell1;nlauren;shohammookerjee;mwhiteway	Zach Wiltshire;Alex Campbell;Lauren Narcross;Shoham Mookerjee;Malcolm Whiteway	None	None	DilanJ;victor14;Nicole.Cappadocia;elenaboueiri;d81024;VHS;Baksz;Melissa~;Lisawalks;Hayfaing;amitmalhotra;steveb;hessamkr	Dilan Jaunky;victor yuan;Nicole Cappadocia-Assaly;elena Boueiri;Dave Oram;Valerie Hayot-Sasson;Marta Bakinowska;Melissa Gurnagul;Lisa Walker;Hayfa AKOUBI;Amit Malhotra;Steven Bouganim;Hessam K.

Pollutants including lead, mercury, and nickel can enter water supplies through improper disposal of waste, industrial manufacturing, and mining.  Previous researchers have developed biological methods of heavy metal sequestration utilizing heavy metal transport proteins and metallothioneins, a class of low-molecular weight proteins with high binding affinities for heavy metals.  In these genetically engineered systems, the transport proteins will preferentially transport a specific heavy metal into the cell and the metallothionein will aggressively bind--driving flux into the cell and sequestering the toxic metal.  Our research aims to modularize previous sequestration systems for nickel and mercury utilizing a yeast metallothionein/glutathione-s-transferase fusion protein as well the transport proteins NixA (nickel transporter) and merT/merP (mercury transporter).  We also plan to extend this sequestration system using a putative lead transport protein.	xs66	Xiling Shen	None	None	None	None	None	None	E.Holmes;S.Sureka;A.Chakravorty;C.Soong;J.Ly;J.Chen;K.Wheeler;M.Sennett;N.Bhatt;O.Spassibojko;P.Sharma;R.Chew;R.Sarkar;R.Ashley;S.Gregg;S.Dong;T.Abbott;T.Su;G.Livermore;J.Fridman;M.Li;A.Han;A.Gittelman;C.Zhang;G.Ratnaparkhi;G.Danias;K.Hui;M.Zhang;N.Patel;N.Chitrao;R.Singh;S.Hoque	Eric Holmes;Swati Sureka;Arun Chakravorty;Christine Soong;Jeffrey Ly;Jonlin Chen;Kyle Wheeler;Mac Sennett;Nupur Bhatt;Olya Spassibojko;Prashant Sharma;Rebecca Chew;Ritvik Sarkar;Ryan Ashley;Sara Gregg;Sharlene Dong;Timothy Abbott;Tina Su;Grace Livermore;Joseph Fridman;Minghao Li;Alex Han;Aaron Gittelman;Casey Zhang;Gargi Ratnaparkhi;George Danias;Kevin Hui;Michelle Zhang;Neema Patel;Neil Chitrao;Rishabh Singh;Samah Hoque	None	None	BBa_K1460000	BBa_K1460999

In order to address the growing threat of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, new antibacterial agents are required. We have engineered a novel phage therapy utilizing the endogenous CRISPR-Cas9 system from Streptococcus pyogenes packaged into non-replicating phage.  CRISPR-Cas9 systems target 20-32 nucleotide DNA sequences within the bacterial genome. Successful CRISPR targeting to the genome leads to a Cas9-mediated DNA double strand break and subsequent cell death. By cloning targeted CRISPR sequences into the endogenous CRISPR-Cas9 system and introducing this system into Escherichia coli by transformation or through phage infection, we have demonstrated sequence specific killing of bacteria in a heterogeneous bacterial population. The broad ranging applications of such an adaptable and cost effective antibiotic therapy range from healthcare to agriculture and represent the future of antibacterial research.	rdowell	Robin Dowell	None	None	None	None	None	None	SZimmermann;kendra;Leighla;johe2273;AlexMartinez;leesahh;kraftdo;joiv5471;Justine93;daga3152;anma3636;jimmynovik;ryadav;Yaqi	Sarah Zimmermann;Kendra Shattuck;Leighla Tayefeh;Josephina Hendrix;Alexander Martinez;Julissa Duran-Malle;Daren Kraft;Joshua Ivie;Justine Wagner;Daniel Garey;Andrea Mariani;Kirill Novik;Rishabh Yadav;Yang Qiao	mdbrasino;timjread;saoh6797;stemmwolf;pogoda	Michael Brasino;Tim Read;Samantha O'Hara;Alexander Stemm-Wolf;Cloe Pogoda	BBa_K1445000	BBa_K1445999

However, the function or robustness of many circuits relies on ultrasensitive, switch-like responses from the transcription factors involved. Currently, CRISPR-based tools have distinctively analog, non-Boolean responses, making them unsuitable for use in functions that require a steep response curve. Tools that introduce Boolean-like ultra-sensitivity into the CRISPR system would increase its versatility for applications in complex gene circuits. We are implementing two possible approaches to demonstrating ultra-sensitivity in CRISPR: cooperative repression and molecular titration.	cgersbach	Charles Gersbach	None	None	None	None	None	None	mattfarnitano;delta.ghoshal;Garima98;mcf28;anthonyciesla;RedSunX;mzhu22	Matthew Farnitano;Udita Ghoshal;Garima Tomar;Matthew Faw;Anthony CIesla;Janan Zhu;Mike Zhu	None	None	BBa_K1545000	BBa_K1545999

This signalling method uses intermediates from metabolic pathways as signalling molecules, and is superior to the conventionally used quorum sensing due to improved orthogonality,  wider range of signalling molecules available, and extensibility. Our project aims to implement the system in Escherichia coli and adapt it to BioBrick format. We will develop three metabolic wires using aromatic degradation, sugar degradation, and cis-genic wires.      To demonstrate its potential, the three wires will then be implemented in a population control system and used to regulate the growth of a single bacterial strain in a mixed population, depending on the population sizes of the remaining strains. Stability of composition of the bacterial populations can thus be increased and more complex biochemical reactions enabled. We will also attempt an alternative use of the wires in an intracellular genetic circuit.	cfrench	Chris French	None	None	bwang;LeHorsfall;caiyizhi;jmarles;aelfick	Baojun Wang;Louise Horsfall;Yizhi Cai;Jon Marles-Wright;Alistair Elfick	None	None	R2ZER0;samireland;clilley;YShino;Carrie;patashons;chiara025;cpumar;philipdav;AStikane;fsalter	Rikki Guy;Sam Ireland;Charlotte Lilley;Yuma Shino;Carrie Pickering;Elize Petrovska;Chiara Asselborn;César Pumar García;Philip Rhys Davies;Anna Stikane;Frazer Salter	Maryia;Pascoe.J.Harvey;dsradford	Maryia Trubitsyna;Pascoe James Harvey;David Radford	BBa_K1399000	BBa_K1399999

The purpose of the lab is to investigate multidrug resistance of Methicillin Resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and to identify the genes involved. We tested the resistance of the transformed E. coli in different antibiotics and could conclude that MRSA showed resistance to antibiotics. We were able to get an idea of which of the DNA were involved in the multidrug resistance. By running PCR, we were able to amplify the DNA involved, and by analyzing this, we could come up with a better understanding of how the multidrug resistance works. An appropriate follow up on the project would be to research the sequence of the identified genes with the hopes of finding a possible drug that destroys even the most MRSA.	synthetic	Eugene Hwang	None	None	youjin	Eugene Hwang	None	None	yeeunlee1107;matthew926;crystal97;chankim;jiyongh0204	Ye Eun Lee;Jihoon Kim;Soojung Lee;Young Chan Kim;Jiyong Hong	None	None	BBa_K1301000	BBa_K1301999

To illustrate this vision of biology, our team created the world’s first biological TouchPad.     On top of serving as a living TouchPad, the BioPad will serve as a fast antibiotic screening device, an apparatus allowing the study of gene activation, and a perfect way to introduce synthetic biology and bio-hardware to the general public via a graspable project.    Our BioPad is made of three components: touch responsive organisms, a custom microfluidic chip, and a mini-computer serving as a signal detector. Once touched, the BioPad responds quickly by emitting light or fluorescence.    The biological engineering behind our project combines protein complementation techniques to dimerization in E. Coli and S. cerevisiae stress pathways. Split reporter proteins from fluorescent proteins, and luciferases were fused to the dimerizing proteins, allowing signal emission upon stress.	groovescience	Bart Deplancke	None	None	acamf;Spock;oleg.mikhajlov;BGN;epetrova;maerkl;MBS	Antonio Meireles-Filho;Rachana Pradhan;Oleg Mikhajlov;Barbara Grisoni;Ekaterina Petrova;Sebastian Maerkl;Maroun Bou Sleiman	None	None	Robert_Baldwin;ionepla;aaardeto;sakura.nussbaum;n.huwiler;thellfalcon;gjrepond;LuciePetetin;Vitello;romanepfl;Varum;Darth_Vader;tsimonet;arthurgiroux	Robert Edward Baldwin;Ione Pla Puigsubirà;Axel de Tonnac;Sakura Nussbaum;Nikolaus Huwiler;Jin Hyuk Chang;Grégoire Repond;Lucie Petetin-Patillon;Bastien Duckert;Romane Breysse;Içvara barbier;Cécile Piot;Thomas Simonet;Arthur Giroux	None	None	BBa_K1486000	BBa_K1486999

Mosaicoli aims at investigating emergence of complex patterns from a simple rule by engineering a cellular automaton into E. coli. This automaton comprises a grid of colonies on a 3D-printed millifuidic chip. Each colony is either in an ON or OFF state and updates its state by integrating signals from its neighbors according to a genetically pre-programmed logic rule. Complex patterns, like Sierpinski triangles, are visualized by fluorescence after several steps of row-wise propagation. The implementation of quorum sensing based sequential logic computation  is challenged by leakiness and crosstalk present in biological systems. Mosaicoli overcomes these issues by exploiting multichannel orthogonal communication, riboregulators and integrase-based XOR logic gates. Successfully engineering such a reliable system not only enables a better understanding of emergent patterns, but also provides novel building blocks for biological computers.	sven	Sven Panke	None	None	joergs;kobibenenson	Joerg Stelling;Yaakov Benenson	None	None	danger;mbahls;lnadine;sumana;clormeau;eledieu;meistefa	Daniel Gerngross;Maximilian Bahls;Nadine Lobsiger;Sumana Srivatsa;Claude Lormeau;Elise Ledieu;Stefanie Meier	sabine.oesterle;angelicb;luwidmer	Sabine Oesterle;Bartolomeo Angelici;Lukas Widmer	BBa_K1541000	BBa_K1541999

Our team wants to heighten awareness about environmental pollution and particularly its devastating consequences on the aquatic life. In this line of thinking we are driven to design a bioremediation tool to decrease the marine pollution and protect aquatic ecosystems. We aim at tackling elements of the main pollutant families by focusing on 5 toxic agents: Polychlorinated Biphenyls, nitrite, phenol, lead and cadmium.  The bioremediation tool will be based on Pseudovibrio denitrificans, a bacterium living in symbiosis with Spongia officinalis. Our goal is to engineer the bacterium to detect, signal and degrade/capture pollutants and to bring it as new chassis in the iGEM competition. The project’s originality lies on the duo formed by Pseudovibrio denitrificans and its symbiotic sponge. Combining these two organisms allows for safe containment of the engineered strain while the extensive filtration capacity of the sponge stimulates the optimal sensing, signaling, and capturing of pollutants in water.	npollet	Nicolas Pollet	None	None	None	None	None	None	JulieZ;Baudoin;Sophie_Gontier;CecileJ;wDigan;NoémieBC;nmendy;SophiaB;ALOUIS;Bernard;Fxlehr;chagza;laurabibi;Rbodinier;chesne_j;Matthieu	Julie Zaworski;Baudoin Delépine;Sophie Gontier;Cecile JACRY;William Digan;Noémie BERENGER-CURRIAS;Nandjafot  MENDY;Sophia Belkhelfa;Anais LOUIS;Bernard JESOP;François-Xavier Lehr;Chaima Gzara;Laura MATABISHI;Romain Bodinier;Johanna Chesnel;Matthieu Da Costa	abassoblandin;Tiff;vadeo;TriCer	adrien basso blandin;Tiffany Souterre;Pierre Parutto;Tristan Cerisy	BBa_K1413000	BBa_K1413999

In order to fashion a more effective microbial fuel cell, we need to monitor the viability of bacteria within the fuel cell.  Microbial fuel cells produce electricity and water when metal-breathing bacteria respire via an anode placed within an anaerobic compartment of the fuel cell.  In order to monitor the health of these power-generating anaerobes, we designed an operon that will cause the microbes to fluoresce when growing in the oxygen-depleted anode chamber.  Our operon consists of an oxygen-sensitive promoter, which activates gene expression in the absence of oxygen, and an open reading frame, which encodes a protein that fluoresces without the need for oxygen.   This simple reporter system will allow us to determine when anaerobic conditions inside the fuel cell are optimal for bacteria growth and power generation.	mrtbiology	Mark Trice	None	None	None	None	None	None	igemjonathon;bk082;ltved;Cinders96;acruz1;kandrushko;Tinu96	jonathon bradley soward II;Kevin Jankowski;Levi Hooper;Dillon Kestner;Andrew Cruz;Kyle Andrushko;Alan Nguyen	rozakd;dlmgary	David Rozak;Gary Lopez	BBa_K1269000	BBa_K1269999

One problem is what to do with existing wastes including leaking coal ash ponds. Another issue is the efficient production of an alcohol that is effective as a fuel, easy and inexpensive to produce, and will function within the current infrastructure. This year, we improved the sensitivity of our Cadmium detector using sensitivity tuners.  We are developing a strain of E. coli resistant to isobutanol and cloning GlmY, GlmZ and IlvM  which are genes involved in the isobutanol production pathway .       Addition of sensitivity tuners has improved the cadmium detector approximately 4-fold, from 10mM to 2.5mM, still over the federal limit. The isobutanol resistant strain of E. coli can tolerate 3 times as much isobutanol as the original strain. Finally, we have successfully isolated the glmZ coding region and have cloned it into the BioBrick vector.

Oxygen levels depletion in the lake directly affect the flora and fauna, making it less hospitable or even deadly. Our goal is to produce a biosensor that can easily and inexpensively detect anoxia in different regions of the lake. Using an oxygen promoter in addition with the biological markers RFP and GFP we could theoretically detect low dissolved oxygen levels in water samples. In addition, we intend to use a second construct with an Iron promoter to detect iron concentrations that also endanger the sustainability of living organisms in the lake. Once we identify critical regions of the Lake, our report could incentivate Civil Council and authorities to propose concrete legal initiatives to reduce pollution in the identified areas and start remediation campaigns.

Nonetheless, the concept of inducible gene expression is often difficult for students to understand. To help students gain a better understanding of inducible gene expression, we developed ""BactoArt"", a multicomponent, inducible expression system that allows students to visualize gene regulation in action.  First, different fluorescent protein (FP) color variants (e.g., CFP, GFP, or RFP) were placed under the control of specific inducible promoters. The inducers can then be patterend onto a petri dish—using either a paintbrush or an inkjet printer—before plating BactoArt bacteria, leading to selective induction of a given FP. We simultaneously induced GFP and RFP from pXyl and pLac, respectively, and measured their fluorescence intensity over time.

We designed a protein for plants, Top4-Metal Binding Protein (T4-MBP), composed of four different domains for the binding of heavy metals. We have chosen the domains from different organisms considering heavy metals with a global relevance: copper, arsenic, zinc and cadmium. Our goal is to produce the T4-MBP in plants, where it will be transported out of the plant cells to attach itself to the cellulose. The binding of the heavy metals via plants is supposed to work in water or on ground to clean up many different areas containing heavy metals. Furthermore we have other fields of application, like the purification of drinking water. With our project we want to provide the world an easy way to remove heavy metals where chemical solutions are lacking.

Developing regions that rely heavily on agriculture, but have less regulations related to pesticide use tend to suffer the most from pesticide pollution.  Organophosphates (OP) represent a large class of toxic pesticides used heavily in these areas.  We have designed novel devices to detect these toxic pollutants in waterways called PUPS, or Paper Utilizing Pesticide Sensors.  These devices are paper-based with 3D printed shells, making them very cost effective for use in poor areas worldwide.  The PUPS will utilize a fusion protein that will be produced in E. coli to degrade organophosphates into 4-nitrophenol (4NP), which OPs degrade into naturally over time.  The 4NP will then be reduced in order to electrochemically measure the 4NP concentration at cheap, graphite electrodes.  These reactions all occur within cellulose paper, which drives the microfluidic movement of the samples.

We have designed an information encoding and storage system in the E.coli curli biofilm network. In our system, bacteria are engineered to produce a mixture of curli subunits that can later be read out as information. Our system can be put under the control of any environmentally sensitive promoter, facilitating the practicality of using biosensors in the field. Other potential applications include cryptography and nanoscale patterning. This system represents a novel method by which information can be stored in a scaleable nanomaterial with functional potential. Living materials offer an advantage over classical materials because they are adaptable, versatile, and can self-pattern complex architectures.	neeljoshi	Neel Joshi	None	None	JRRussell	Jonathan Russell	None	None	nlarusstone;mmmlong;jonahsaltzman;traphel	Nicholas Larus-Stone;Michelle Long;Jonah W.

Conventionally, control depends on gene expression, however modifications made after expression enable fast and precise regulation. Our team has designed a universal toolbox for modifying proteins post-translationally utilising inteins and sortases.    In the natural process of protein splicing auto-catalytic inteins excises themself leaving the flanking chains reconnected. Similarly, sortases identify, cut and rejoin protein sequences. Comprising a variety of standardised parts our toolbox can specifically change whole amino-acid sequences therefore regulating proteins via assembly or protein cleavage.    Very curiously, these methods enable circularisation of enzymes rendering them thermodynamically stable and resistant to exoproteases, which will be applicable in biotechnological procedures requiring high temperatures. Our software selects the best technique for circularisation and a distributed computing platform facilitates the calculations.    Taken together we provide a new foundational advance introducing full post-translational modification to Synthetic Biology.	reils	Roland Eils	None	None	bdv;julia_n	Barbara Di Ventura;Julia Neugebauer	None	None	Jakob;bunnech;Linchen;maexlich;jan_glx;Jelisaweta;huhny;cahlmann;igemnils;MB;MaxW;silvan	Jakob Kreft;Charlotte Bunne;Carolin Schmelas;Max Horn;Jan Gleixner;Elisabeth Schäfer;Anna Huhn;Constantin Ahlmann-Eltze;Nils Klughammer;Magdalena Büscher;Max Waldhauer;Silvan Schmitz	pirwlan;stephenkraemer;philippbayer;Joel_B	Pierre Wehler;Stephen Krämer;Philipp Bayer;Joel Beaudouin	BBa_K1362000	BBa_K1362999

Our goal is to engineer a strain of Yarrowia lipolytica, which is capable of detecting alkanes, to turn color in the presence of these volatile compounds. We hope that we can use this yeast to detect melanoma cheaply and non-invasively (perhaps in a cancer detecting band-aid). To achieve our goal, we will build a reporter construct that uses an alkane sensitive promoter to drive the expression of a blue chromoprotein from the coral Acropora millepora which should cause the yeast to turn blue in the presence of alkanes. Our parts include an alkane response element (3xARE1), a leu minimal promoter, our reporter gene (blue chromoprotein), and a terminator (XPR2). Once the reporter construct is assembled, we will clone it into a Yarrowia lipolytica shuttle vector and integrate it into the yeast genome.	bobatola	Richard Murray	None	None	None	None	None	None	fletchersk;seanalc1;SpatzKC;Spennatojm;kimkm;alexmcintyre;stanleyJS;davischase;NBeggs	Keegan Fletcher;Seana Corbin;Kevin Spatz;Jordan Spennato;Krystal Kim;Alex McIntyre;Jay Stanley;Chase Davis;Noah Beggs	None	None	BBa_K1504000	BBa_K1504999

Its deleterious hazards intensify with the odorless, colorless and fat- soluble properties, which enable dioxins to accumulate in vivo thus threaten almost the whole biosphere.   To detect dioxins blisteringly, we have constructed device for rapid detection of dioxins inside yeast. We utilized associability between the gene for testing dioxins of MOUSE as receptor  and dioxins as signal, together with the regulation conducted by lexA operator to downstream  promoters so that the fusion protein combined bydioxin receptor and lexA can induce downstream gene with the presence of dioxins. Eventually, we can achieve our goal of detecting dioxins rapidly through the system of positive feedback of fluorescence. We additionally design a secretive gather part by emulsifying protein to add the soluble ability of dioxins and anchoring the dioxin degradation enzyme on the surface of the yeast.

Processing modules can alter the way they process information in order to adapt to environmental changes. The circuit we designed can rewire its connections between parts and devices to implement multiple functions with the help of site-specific recombination systems. Host overload and unexpected interplay between modules are prevented in our design.

Indeed, the use of surface-specific protein particularly benefits the biotechnology research field, and extensively the synthetic biology field, in depollution alternative strategies but also in the medical field by improving the dialysis’ filter specificty on various metals for renal-insufficient patients.	ylouis	Yoann LOUIS	None	None	cdorelflamant;alex273;vdesjardin;Agnès;Eccho;Marianne;mpescudie	Corinne Dorel-Flamant;Alexandre Duprey;Valérie DESJARDIN;Agnès Rodrigue;Emiel van der Kouwe;Marianne Chouteau;Marie-Pierre Escudié	None	None	Tcyr;Alexia;JulietteP;elorteau;madalina;adam.a;choupx;zhangyang19923;aleboedec;TCruzel;AfricaSmith;bremy;AliceB	TCHING CHI YEN Romain;Alexia Vidal;Juliette paillet;Etienne LORTEAU;madalina cercel;Adam Amara;Chloé Marquet--Jouve;ZHANG Yang;Alice Le Boedec;Thomas Cruzel;Africa Smith de Diego;Benjamin Rémy;Alice Blot	phlejeune;poger;comten;vforest;benoitdrogue;Dams;Suxiaohui;pdasilva	Philippe Lejeune;Phil Oger;Nicolas Comte;Valérie Forest;Benoît Drogue;Damien JACQUES;Viviane Chansavang;Pedro DA SILVA	BBa_K1404000	BBa_K1404999

We can’t deny that plastic give us a lot of benefit, though overproduction of plastic could give serious impact for the environment if not treated properly. The total of global plastic is estimated to exceed 24.39 million tons in 2015; therefore, appropriate treatment is necessary.    To solve the problem, we try to degrade plastic using synthetic bacteria. We establish ompA protein fused with LC-Cutinase in Escherichia coli BL21 thus exposing the degrading enzymes on the surface membrane of bacteria. We also construct a cassette comprised of glycoaldehyde reductase and glycoaldehyde dehydrogenase which responsible in metabolising ethylene glycol as byproduct of degradation. We use constitutive promoter for both construct, thus making it necessary to create a modul of reporter and self regulatory to maintain system efficiency and minimizing severe cytoplasmic stress from formation of inclusion body aggregate.	131835246	Sony Suhandono	None	None	Dwijayanti;dessy_natalia;maelita;indrawibowo;mapri	Ari Dwijayanti;Dessy Natalia;Maelita R.

One of the most accepted theories explaining its origin suggests that it is triggered by the chemical modifications of Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL), which are susceptible to oxdiations; it is believed that these oxidized products accumulate on the artery walls (tunica intima), generating an inflammatory process that will ultimately cause the development of atheroma plaques. LDL products are being oxidized by the interaction with Reactive Oxygen Species in the bloodstream, this can occur either within fatty acids or sterols, such as 7-ketocholesterol, one of the most common reaction products. We pretend to develop a new synthetic model capable of degrading the oxidized form of cholesterol by using gene therapy.

Chitosan has a global market value of $20 billion USD and it is widely used in pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic industries, among many others, due to its biodegradability, non-toxicity and biocompatibility properties. The traditional extraction method involves the use of acids and alkalis that makes the process expensive, highly pollutant and non-standardized; that’s why we propose a novel method using B. subtilis and a modified E. coli, which contains 6 enzymes capable of cutting and deacetylating chitin for the generation of chitosan. This way, KF provides tools for the innovation and development of new biotechnological products, the creation of jobs, the solution of an existing waste disposal problem and the education of people about the advantages of biotechnology in Mexico.

An assay for coliphage detection has been developed which employs the release of the host indicator cell beta-galactosidase enzyme activity by lytic coliphage and the conversion of a colorimetric substrate, shortening the APHA time to 3 hrs. We're engineering cell lines containing the gene fragments of LacZalpha and will use an E.coli cell line with the M15 mutation expressing the omega fragment of Beta-galactosidase. We're introducing a cassette of coliphage cell lysis genes under the control of a coliphage promoter to accelerate the enzyme fragment release, further reducing test time. Alternative to the enzymatic read-out we are exploring a microfluidic system to detect the lysis of the cells. Our goal is to design a fast-acting hand-held coliphage biosensor device that can be used by someone without any special technical expertise.   Our device is useful in rapidly reporting the contamination of recreational waters or assuring drinkable water in developing nations.	geotwaddle	George Twaddle	None	None	carisio	Christina Arisio	None	None	Knye0990;mchibambo;ltrokhina;jcampbell188;JCunningham;Kenan;Judah	Karinne Nye;Michelle Chibambo;Lyuda Trokhina;James Kevin Campbell;Joanne Cunningham;Kenan Steele;Judah Easton	None	None	BBa_K1477000	BBa_K1477999

Chitosan is derived from chitin through the N-deacetylation process.  Uses include agriculture, medicine, and industry. Research in our local community led us to research applying chitosan in an agriculture setting by preserving post harvest fruit from fungal infections.  Current technology to produce chitosan involves a caustic chemical process that is detrimental to the environment. An alkali sodium hydroxide removes the acetyl group from chitin to produce chitosan. Fortunately, this conversion process also takes place in the natural environment in a multitude of organisms through the aid of an enzyme called chitin deacetylase, or CDA.   The main focus of our project was to obtain a CDA gene from a eukaryotic source, engineer a suitable vector with promoter, and transform into a bacterial host using the standard Biobrick assembly.

Astrogliosis, a cellular response to such neural insults, leads to the formation of a non-functional “glial scar” and an inhibitory cellular environment that impedes neural regrowth and recovery. Our project involves engineering microglia, the mobile immune cells of the brain, to package and deliver a therapeutic plasmid specifically to central nervous system cells. The plasmid encodes a reprogramming factor that converts reactive astrocytes into new neurons, helping to restore the functional neuronal population and permit regrowth of damaged connections. We have also developed a novel plasmid selection system that bypasses antibiotic-based selection to reduce the size of the reprogramming plasmid. This project has the potential to provide a novel, non-invasive rehabilitative therapy that could lead to significantly improved functional recovery following brain injury or disease onset.

When this happens, antibiotics can enter the water table. This selective pressure causes organisms in the water to adapt and become resistant to the antibiotics. Reducing the amount of antibiotics in the water supply will help to reduce this selective pressure. To remediate antibiotics in the environment we plan to generate a strain of E. coli that will export an enzyme known as Beta-lactamase to degrade Beta-lactam antibiotics. Ultimately, this will help reduce the selective pressure causing the evolution for antibiotic resistance.

However, MFCs is hard to determine the contaminants concentrations which is a major drawback for MFCs applications. We found that the electricity produced by MFCs was somewhat related to the substrates concentrations such as P-nitrophenol (PNP) in anode or Chromium (VI) in cathode. Then a novel MFC system was designed. For anode strain, we’ve cloned a PNP sensor sequence and a riboflavin into Escherichia coli. The recombinants is able to detect PNP and produce riboflavin to boost electrical generation when co-cultured with Shewanella oneidensis. In the cathode, gene codes chromate (VI) reductase Yief was cloned into E.coli. The stability of MFCs has been improved and the electricity generated was correlated with the substrates. Moreover, we’ve designed a program which can monitor the contaminants concentrations in MFCs.

Our project aims to engineer a novel treatment for obesity. By modifying the natural CRP pathway, we will turn the commensal bacterium Escherichia E.coli Nissle 1917 into a “sugar sponge” that will absorb excess carbohydrates before they can be taken up in the human intestines.   Our engineered bacteria is aimed at obese people who have tried other approaches to weight loss, but have failed to see any results. Other uses could include patients who need to lose weight before surgery. The bacteria would be delivered in the form of a pill or yogurt drink.   Our project will include an in-depth sociological analysis of modern attitudes to obesity based on research and data collected from surveys, exploring public opinion regarding body weight as well as synthetic biology and genetic modification. We have used the results to direct our engineering strategies.

We’ve developed a biological device that comprises of both a qualitative detector for this dangerous gas and a conversion system to transform it into carbon dioxide. As for detection, CO sensitive promoters pCooM and pCooF from Rhodosprillum rubrum will initiate the production of fluorescent proteins in the presence of CO. Optic sensors will be used to track the production of these proteins and if the sensors pick up data indicating that CO is present; an alarm will be triggered. Meanwhile, the conversion system of our device will utilize a Cyanobacteria enzyme called Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase (CODH), which converts CO into CO2. We also have a kill-switch design based on the lac-operon. The kill-switch mechanism will be activated to avoid any contamination of the environment, in case the altered bacteria escape the device.

Many plastic bottles are not reusable. Some tougher, reusable plastic bottles may cause cancer. The main disadvantage of plastic bottles is that so many of them end up in landfills instead of being recycled. It takes hundreds of years for plastic bottles to biodegrade, and the degrading process emits toxic chemicals into the air.  We may alter the destiny of plastic in useful way.  Our project aims to keep the environment clean with the degradation of PET to pyruvate by E. coli. With this project, while the environment will be cleaned from PET, the E. coli would add pyruvate to the cell cycle and use it as a new energy source for itself.  We will biodegrade PET to Catechol. Then catechol to 2-hydroxymuconate resulting in pyruvate.	akkayams	Mahinur AKKAYA	None	None	None	None	None	None	ilkem.kumru;Y.Seniz;Maercyl;z;helin.tercan;irembstzl;tüzel;Yasemin Ceyhan;Yasemin Kuvvet	Ilkem Kumru;eniz Yüksel;Burak K;l;Helin Tercan;irem Ba;yasemin.ceyhan;yasemin.kuvvet	U;cayca;rç;cgdmylmz;sssu;o;Drkcn;melikedonertas;alisankayabolen;an Kayabölen	ghujka;urcan SAKIZLI;Ayça Ç;r;Cigdem Yilmaz;Side Selin Su Yirmibe;lu;Dorukcan Özköse;Handan Melike Dönerta;Ali	BBa_K1392000	BBa_K1392999

Experimental practices may differ immensely across laboratories and precise details of these practices may be lost or forgotten as skilled faculty or students leave the lab to pursue other endeavors. Furthermore, there are few well-defined protocols that are generally agreed upon by the scientific community, in part due to the lack of a system that can supply a measure of a protocol’s acceptance. In order to address these problems, we set out to build a database that integrates a crowdsourced ratings and comments system to serve as a protocol curator that enables wet lab investigators to compare various protocol efficacies, quantify a protocol’s acceptance within the scientific community, and provide an avenue through which experiential knowledge can be communicated.	mcammer	Marc Ammerlaan	None	None	None	None	None	None	evolver;jheis;jesscj;khenckel;cepark;kjflynn;kush;lankrist;chryliu;bargho	Joshua Abramson;Jon Heiselman;Jessica Johnson;Kelly Henckel;Chris Parker;Kaitlin J.

Rising levels of mercury due to mining activities, industrial catalysts, agricultural fungicides, and the burning of fossil fuels has resulted in the pollution of many ecosystems and water reservoirs. Cleanup of mercury contamination using current technology is either not feasible or incredibly costly. This study describes the engineering of recombinant bacteria that can facilitate the bioremediation of the neurotoxic methylmercury and mercury ions into less toxic form, and reduce other heavy metals. This synthetic microbe was encapsulated within a cost-effective, scalable water filtering device. Device employment could rigorously change the practices used in mercury decontamination efforts by switching to biological rather than chemical processes. Furthermore, this technology can be applied towards bioremediation and biosensing of various heavy metals and organic toxins in the environment.	gralnick	Jeff Gralnick	None	None	casarkar	Casim Sarkar	None	None	Basem;tarnowki.jm;barre378;lucas138;Logan7;srijay;taylorldrdg5;marinovotny;hippx027;huxxx434;PatrickHolec;jennifer.strommen;lemie033;free0388;RoxanaKarami;valeriubortnov;miljk001@umn.edu;reycamilox;JustinSchlitz	Basem Al-Shayeb;Jessica Tarnowski;Cassandra Barrett;Sarah Lucas;Logan Pfaff;Srijay Rajan;Taylor Aldridge;Mari Novotny;Christopher Hipp;Hsiangyu Hu;Patrick Holec;Jennifer Strommen;Niko Le Mieux;Aaron Free;Roxana Karami;Valeriu Bortnov;Tamara Miljkovic;Camilo Rey Bedon;Justin Schlitz	jimmyellinger;fuchs092;Skog0122;heins049;perdue366	James Ellinger;Tanner Fuchs;Aunica Kane;Stephen C.

Coal is one of the primary sources of global energy and produces carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollutants, among others, which contribute to global warming and acid rain formation. Fixing nitrogen through Cyanothece has another benefit besides reducing pollution; the end products are ammonia compounds which are a major component of fertilizer.

These cause neuron death and disrupt the proper functioning of surviving neurons. Despite the severity of the disease, Alzheimer's diagnosis and treatment are limited to post-symptomatic psychological methods and so there is great need for molecular detection and alleviation mechanisms.     To address this, we have genetically engineered a system to diagnose and treat Alzheimer’s disease. Diagnosis is based on the detection of two Alzheimer’s-specific biomarkers in the brain: extracellular beta-amyloid protein oligomers and the intracellular miRNA profile of afflicted neurons. Successful detection triggers a treatment module that reduces beta-amyloid levels, thereby preventing neuronal death and slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s symptoms.    This research demonstrates an approach that could inform an eventual treatment, not only for Alzheimer’s disease, but for numerous other human afflictions.	rweiss	Ron Weiss	None	None	teague;jbabb	Brian Teague;Jonathan W Babb	None	None	rjliu;raashedrazi;aleffell;jiaqixie;krbrink;amgarcia;asjm;lylaatta;orangethemarker;eersland;shinjini37;janderson;clrichar;awchen;aquagirl	"Jing Wei ""Raymond"" Liu;Raashed Raziuddin;Alex Leffell;Jiaqi Xie;Kathryn Brink;Alexa Garcia;Alexander Smith;Lyla Atta;Gary Burnett;Erik Ersland;Shinjini Saha;James Anderson;Christian Richardson;Andrew Wei Chen;Abigail Weiss"	klathem;stevenk;eerik	Kyle Lathem;Steven Keating;Kristjan Eerik Kaseniit	BBa_K1391000	BBa_K1391999

The four main causes of acne are comedogenesis, sebum production, proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes, and inflammation in the form of papules, pustules, and nodules. Triglycerides, wax esters, squalene, free fatty acids, and sapienic acid are the main components of sebum.  Our team has created a biosystem that reduces the presence of sebaceous components (primarily wax esters).     Our mechanism includes two proteins of interest-Medium Chain Alcohol Dehydrogenase and Medium Chain Aldehyde Dehydrogenase in two identical biological circuits to change the structure of wax esters and other lipids, rendering them insufficient for bacterial consumption. We included a basic promoter, RBS and terminator, making the protein-coding domain the only variable between the two circuits. We hope this mechanism facilitates sebum breakdown and reduces inflammatory responses of the P. acne bacteria.	cresch	Christopher Resch	None	None	None	None	None	None	susanliu;isabelmalleyne;dqlynch;Pranavr;soh1213;BHou56;Lucy.7a11;y.he.uan;avipoola;mritika.c;Mayank;Montgomeryigem;ams267;emilymck;pkothari;ssb1329;ydatar4;srtigem;Tjha;Avinash;$hawn2016;CindyFan;emilyma;BhargavVemulapalli;boogle356;nchhugani;Axolotl911;vhu96;ankurmehta;casey.chow;shannonlu162;Tiffanylin;solee1997;aditya;lockisrock;kishoreaman;joanna.li358;nikalmighty	Shuning Liu;Isabel Alleyne;Dylan Lynch;Pranav Reddy;Sarah Seiyoung Oh;Junlan Lu;Lucy Zhang;Yuan He;Avinash Poola;Mritika Contractor;Mayank Kishore;Robert Dembinski;Ankit Shah;Emily McKinnon;Pankti Kothari;Sushil Bhandaru;Yesh Datar;Srikar Tallavajhala;Tejas Jha;Avinash Boppana;Shawn Bhattacharya;Cindy Fan;Emily Ma;Bhargav Vemulapalli;Paige Qi;Neha Chhugani;Matt Durik;Vivian Hu;Ankur Mehta;Casey Chow;Shannon Lu;Tiffany Lin;Ian Lee;Aditya Mehta;Abhinav Gurrala;Aman Kishore;Joanna Li;Nikhil Maganti	None	None	BBa_K1249000	BBa_K1249999

Most conventional treatments have harmful side effects, such as pollution and drug resistance. Currently, the use of pheromone traps is one of the cleanest methods to specifically attract and kill insects. Instead of carrying out the complex biosynthesis pathway of pheromones, we choose the simple act of expressing the DNA sequence of Pheromone Biosynthesis Activating Neuropeptide (PBAN). PBAN is similar to pheromone in its species-specificity. Once a specific PBAN comes in contact with and stimulates the target species, specific pheromones will be emitted to attract more of said species. In our project, we have successfully constructed and expressed in E. coli PBANs of nine different species and also built a capturing device. Hopefully this model can be widely used in the future when PBANs of more insects are found.	wenurea	Wen Liang, Chen	None	None	Ryan;Dawn	Huai-En Lu;Hsiao-Ching Lee	None	None	roy;Norz;judas;LexGHE;RoxLan;Sam771;Mick;alex19950425;Frankie;rach900166;Jack;PALADIN;joseph83414;hotsungyu;Chad;Boneng;elnodino;SandyTAI;yizaochen;SwartCat;shiro;jc7431119;h89161h;Yen;wanghs	CHEN,JING-WEN;LEE, WEI-HAO;Kuan-Ting Liu;GE,PENG-JHE;LAN,KUAN-CHUN;HSIEH, TING-YANG;Min-Chien Hsiao;Jain Li Lu;FENG-CHI WU;Rachel Lee;Lung-Chieh Chen;WANG, GOANG-JIUN;LU, CHENG-LUNG;HO, TSUNG YU;CHIU, CHUN-WEI;SYU,BO-NENG;PAN, CHUN-HAO;TAI, CHUN-SAN;CHEN, YI-TSAO;CHIANG, PO-WEI;Malvin Jefri;Chao-Di Chang;Helena Lee;Wen-Hui Cheng;Hao-Hsien Wang	None	None	BBa_K1415000	BBa_K1415999

GlaA5 and GlaA3 can be used as homologous arm sequences that can mediate specific recombination. After homologous recombine between homologous arm sequences, we will get the transgenic Aspergillus Niger cells only express amilCP gene which can be easily detected by blue color.

To be more specific, water sources can be contaminated by heavy metals leaching from industrial waste; acid rain can exacerbate this process by releasing heavy metals trapped in soils. Considering the properties of heavy metals, unable to decay and thus a different kind of challenge for medication, we have constructed a heavy metal detection and recycle system. Briefly, our system is based on a special strain of E.coli containing smt-locus, CDS7 and an unfamiliar flocculation gene. The system can detect the existence of metal zinc and cadmium through visualized pigment gene driven by the smt-locus, recycle these heavy metal ions by forming nanocrystals resulted from CDS7 and flocculate the nanocrystals. Eventually, we can realize our double-win goal, safeguarding our environment by removing heavy metal ions and yielding a great amount of nanocrystals.	vonov	Yu Wang	None	None	None	None	None	None	reageyao;cindylee;jing9477;HeZhang;ErinLiu;LIYAJING;liuzhongdong;XinZhao;HemingWang;Qingtian;DanhuiMa;LBJie;LiTong;zwx	Li Yao;Zhi Li;Yuwei Sun;He Zhang;Zhiqi Liu;YaJing Li;zhongdong liu;Xin Zhao;Heming Wang;Shuxin Jin;Danhui Ma;Baojie Lv;Tong Li;Weixuan Zhao	None	None	BBa_K1509000	BBa_K1509999

The ability to quickly and inducibly degrade a signal, repressor, or other protein would greatly improve the sensitivity and timing of biological switches.  Auxin, a plant hormone, is involved in nearly every aspect of plant growth and development. In the presence of auxin, auxin receptors induce polyubiquitylation of a targeted protein, leading to degradation by the proteasome. This hormone based protein degradation has previously been used to create inducible protein degradation in yeast and mammalian cells. However, a parallel system – using jasmonic acid as the small molecule inducer – is also found in plants. Our goal is to use both the auxin and jasmonic acid responsive pathways to develop a quick, efficient, and bioorthogonal system to control protein stability in yeast.	vzepeda	Veronica Zepeda	None	None	None	None	None	None	zlopezmeraz;Mhawn999;jdbeard;jbautista;tori_speicher;khurramfahim	Zoe Meraz;Matthew Hawn;Josh Beard;Janice Bautista;Tori Speicher;khurram fahim	None	None	BBa_K1347000	BBa_K1347999

Diagenes	Streptocccus Pyogenes is a severe bacteria which can result in some ilnesses such as  pharyngitis. Diagnosis of S. Pyogenes can be done in some ways. However some ways are fairly expensive or takes more than a day to detect. We designed our system to solve this problem by using synbio.    We simply found the sequence which can be cleavaged by the protease, SpeB, secreted by S. Pyogenes. In our system we used a wall protein which is linked to cleavage site by a sequence of linker. On the other side of the cleavage site, we located Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase(C2,3O) monomer. When cleavage site is eradicated by SpeB, free C2,3Os form tetramers. Catechol is a substance that reacts with Oxygene. As a result of this reaction yellow colour is produced. This system is fairly fast in comparison to blood agar method. The system can also be modified to detect other demerit bacteria.

Therefore, we strive to transform E.coli into a biological factory that produces more FFAs of different length of carbon chain and saturation levels in both an efficient and a controlled manner.   To achieve that, we will introduce FFA desaturase and various thioesterase, key enzymes for unsaturated FFA production and FFA synthesis respectively, and different operon structure into the engineering E.coli. Also, we design a fluorescence system composed of Transcriptional Regulatory Protein FadR to monitor the FFA producing status in E.coli. In this case, we can produce different FFAs by applying different signals to operons in E.coli and detect the real time production status by fluorescence report.

This heavy increase in atmospheric CO2 is thought to be caused by the heavy industrialisation of our civilisation with the use of fossil fuels. With the potential impact climate change could have for many ecosystems globally, it becomes apparent we need to slow-down, if not prevent these changes in order to preserve our current habitat. One strategy for reducing the CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere is biological carbon fixation. The project undertaken will look at establishing the lactate inducible expression system into Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Once established, glucose oxidase (GOx) will be incorporated into this expression system. It is proposed that Glucose oxidase will prevent respiration of the organism, thereby increasing its carbon fixation capacity.	eivnd	Eivind Almaas	None	None	rahmilale;igem_martin	Rahmi Lale;Martin Hohmann-Marriott	None	None	ronjakri;paalro;lamja264;camilree;EivindD;lhwme;eliasha;Omtvedt	Ronja Hesthammer;Pål Røynestad;Jacob Lamb;Camilla Marstrander Reehorst;Eivind Bøe Drejer;HyeWon Lee;Elias Honerød Augestad;Line Omtvedt	None	None	BBa_K1424000	BBa_K1424999

Many computational methods, such as Dijkstra algorithm etc., can solve it in a tolerable computational complexity. However, as the technology of the traditional silicon computers is gradually meeting its physical limits, new methods of the high-volume computing has been looked for for years. As developing rapidly, synthetic biology makes bacterial computing possible and great potential.     Here, we designed a series of genetic circuits in Escherichia coli to solve the SPP in a directed graph. The nodes and arrows are programed as well-assigned promoters and transcription factors (TFs) respectively. The paths in the graph are described by the transcriptional regulatory cascades. The promoter of destination node in SPP is followed by a green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter. According theoretical analysis, we can find the the shortest path with linear computational complexity.

Saliva testing is non-invasive procedure that allows detecting OSCC biomarkers. Elevated level of p53 protein was identified in OSCC patients at different stages of the disease. Camelid antibodies containing only variable regions, nanobodies (VHH) and single-chain variable regions (scFv) with VH and VL, are becoming popular in research and diagnostics. It was identified that VL region showed higher affinity for p53 than VHH, and dimerization of VL regions increases their affinity up to ten folds.  Camelid antibodies can be conjugated to other proteins without loss of function. They can be expressed and secreted in such common model organism as E. coli, reducing the cost of antibody production. Therefore, the aim of this project is to design biosensor to detect p53 in saliva samples for OSCC diagnosis using nanobodies expressed in bacteria.	labstud	Tim Shipley	None	None	Arnat	Arnat Balabiyev	None	None	BanuOspanova;scooby111;Dana;Azhoni;Luiza;DRAltynay;Zeinaf;Minzdrav;nikita.tsyba	Banu Ospanova;Mukhtar Sadykov;Dana Stambekova;Azhar Zhailauova;Luiza Niyazmetova;Altynay Abdirakhmanova;Zeinaf Muradova;Samat Bayakhmetov;Nikita Tsyba	None	None	BBa_K1335000	BBa_K1335999

Constructed by placing a wintergreen odor enzyme generator downstream from a heat sensitive promoter, the bacteria should emit a noticeable wintergreen smell starting near a human body temperature of 37°C.  As the temperature increases the heat sensitive promoter gradually decreases the effect of the repressor to allow for maximum wintergreen enzyme generation around 42°C.  The creation of this biobrick will serve as a first step towards a multiple input bio-sensing system.  Such a system may include the input of heat and different wavelengths for activation.  Both pursuits will help achieve the goal of using bacteria in increasingly complex circuits to more effectively sense the environment.	rvsay	Luc Arvisais	None	None	jpuurunen	Jessica Puurunen	None	None	carterbehm;EugeneYuss;dee17jay18;Twisted;Matt4260;rachelkim;freyamorgan;TaliaMD;Jeremiah;frances;JMTSJ;nicolemelzer;Alidator;noahjnadal;dktully;StevenMHughes	Carter Behm;Alina Arvisais;Delaney Barth;Sydney Koncz;Matthew Marquez;Rachel Kim;Freya Morgan;Talia Mary Dixon;Jeremiah Ellis;Frances Davis;Matthew San Juan;Nicole Melzer;Alida Kelly;Noah Nadal;Daniel Tully;Steven Hughes	None	None	BBa_K1268000	BBa_K1268999

We are constructing a synthetic fluorescent biosensor through GFP fusion to the dcmA promoter, regulated by the DCM-binding protein, DcmR, and maximising the sensitivity and catalytic efficiency of the system through directed evolution.    Our DCM clean-up solution, branded ‘DCMation’, will be user-friendly in a wide range of workplaces and extendable to the disposal of many other harmful substrates.	jarmit	Judy Armitage	None	None	gwadhams	George Wadhams	None	None	phillo92;glen47;olivervince;CorinnaO;JHoffman;MatthewBooth;Shahbano;LeroyLim;SMcGibbon;francescadonnellan;TimAng94;AndyRussell;EmilyPritchett	Philipp Lorenz;Glen-Oliver Gowers;Oliver Vince;Corinna Oswald;Jack Hoffman;Matthew Booth;Shahbano Soomro;Leroy Lim Shen Wing;Siân McGibbon;Francesca Donnellan;Timothy Ang;Andy Russell;Emily Pritchett	None	None	BBa_K1446000	BBa_K1446999

Corynebacterium striatum and Bacillus subtilis are among the main contributors to body odors. One of the objectives of our project is identifying and isolating natural mutants that have non-functional odor-producing enzymes using CRISPRs.   We're also engineering bacteria to degrade smelly molecules: TMA (trimethylamine) and 2-nonenal. The old people smell is mainly due to 2-nonenal. To degrade it, we want to perform directed evolution on skin bacteria. TMA has a fish odor and it appears in people suffering from trimethylaminuria. We will clone the enzyme trimethylamine monooxygenase, which degrades TMA, in E.coli and skin bacteria. Parallelly, we intend to develop a set of primordial odors by cloning enzymes known to catalyze reactions yielding volatile compounds.   We're also focusing on scientific communication, for that, we are developing an online course developed on the Education Genius platform about iGEM high school.	ablindner	Ariel Lindner	None	None	None	None	None	None	Tovila;psatin;crisgt;HenryDeBelly;scientoo;Ula;Ihab;jgarciaa;roussetfrancois;aakriti;Mégane;Ysylvia;judithBoldt;Marguerite;Estefanía;mariannecardon;AlexEv	Antonio Villarreal Larrauri;Pierre-Luc Satin;Cristina Garcia-Timermans;Henry de Belly;Naresh Rambabu;Urszula Czerwinska;Ihab Boulas;Juanma GARCIA;François ROUSSET;Aakriti Jain;Mégane Matysiak;Shuyi(Sylvia) Yang;Judith Boldt;Marguerite Benony;Estefanía Muciño Castillo;marianne cardon;Evans Alexandre	ewintermute;imarcus;MJDeyell;ClovisB;zmarinkovic	Edwin Wintermute;Ian Marcus;Matthew Deyell;Clovis Basier;Zoran Marinkovic	BBa_K1403000	BBa_K1403999

"Synthetic Biology has the power of changing paradigms of society such as our conception of what living beings are.   If we deprive bacteria from their “unnecessary"" functions and have them produce what we need, do these bacteria still possess the status of living organisms or have they become machines? To raise this question, we adopted an artistic approach, as Bio-Art is one of the best way to spark debate with citizens.   We create a concept organism that would reflect these interrogations. We modify Escherichia coli to produce the scent and simulate the ripening process of a lemon. A mixture of bacteria and growth medium will be molded: it will smell, ripe and look like a lemon, but ""ceci n’est pas un citron” - this is not a lemon… or is it?

We used a nahR gene, on plasmid NAH7 (BBa_J61051), which breaks down naphthalene in a cell environment into the more inert catechol. We then use the downstream element BBa_K118021, whose protein product, catechol-2, 3-dioxygenase, catalyzes the conversion of catechol to 2-HMS (2-hydroxymuconate semialdyhyde) a yellow-colored molecule. In addition, we created a cell that will be able to broadly identify other toxic fracking byproducts via a nonspecific SOS cell damage element. The promoter recognizes and binds to a combination of sequences of SOS repressor proteins produced after cellular stress from damaging toxins or radiation. This promoter (BBa_K518010) will be attached to a downstream element (BBa_K592009) coding for a blue-colored protein, so that bacterial cells exhibiting stress can be easily discerned.

Compared to physical or chemical methods, biological treatment for water bloom is less expensive and more environmentally friendly. Hence Peking iGEM is dedicated to constructing engineered microorganisms for the elimination of algae and recovery of ecosystems.     A specific antimicrobial peptide is secreted to disrupt the outer membrane of algae. In addition, we equip our transgenic cells with features that allow for buoyancy and attachment, making our project more efficient. During this process, an enzyme is also secreted to degrade a deleterious product of algae. After eradicating the algae, our engineered bacteria will commit suicide, and the ecosystem is finally restored.    This project is an innovative treatment for water bloom, and has potential applications in the field of ecosystem remediation.	qiPku	Qi Ouyang	None	None	Franklin;SeeSe@	Shiyu Liu;Li Kang	None	None	success;purord.z;evannee;Flamboyant;itsfeng;J;RobinKin;Gardenia;61meng;Xinchangzai;smallonion;Sakura;Helen.LXY;steng1009;jellyfish_cat	Wang, Chenggong;Zhang Zijian;Ni Congjian;Shiyu Zhu;Zhang Fengyu;Wu Jie;Jin Yuji;Mu Xuelang;Meng Liuyi;Jiashuai Hu;Yu Congyu;Yao Lanqiu;Xiaoyu Lu;Sherry Teng;Huang Xiaoyu	Sclereid	Zheng Pu	BBa_K1378000	BBa_K1378999

There is significant demand for the effective bioremediation of cadmium in developing countries and in industrial regions. Current methods are expensive and often produce undesired byproducts. We engineered a strain of magnetotactic bacteria known as Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 for biosorption of cadmium. AMB-1 is a strain of magnetotactic bacteria that aligns to magnetic fields with magnetite-accumulating organelles. This strain has been identified as a suitable chassis as it can be isolated with magnetic forces. A metal transporter gene native to other magnetotactic strains (mntH) and a S-adenosyl-methionine-dependent methyltransferase (smtA) derived from E. coli were incorporated into a genetic circuit designed to maximize biosorption and cadmium tolerance. AMB-1 carrying this design on a shuttle vector plasmid were tested for bioremediation efficiency.	UPenn_Adviser	Brian Y.

We sought to answer such ""combinatorial questions"" using new biophysical models and experimental approaches. First, we employed the CRISPR/Cas9 system to identify the missing enzymes of a metabolic pathway that functions in one organism, but not in another. We demonstrate our approach on a 5-enzyme catabolic pathway that functions in P. putida, but not in E. coli. Once a multi-enzyme pathway functions in a preferred host, the DNA sequence of the system must then be optimized to achieve a desired metabolic activity. We took a forward engineering approach to systematically investigate the differences in translation rate capacity when using either ""frequent"", ""fast"", ""rare"", or ""slow"" synonymous codons during codon optimization of protein coding sequences. Our research will enable metabolic engineers to overcome two of the most commonly encountered combinatorial questions during metabolic pathway engineering."	hsalis	Howard Salis	None	None	trichard	Tom Richard	None	None	esileo;aes5433;clayswack;SKrug11	Emily Sileo;Ashlee Smith;Clay Swackhamer;Sam Krug	None	None	BBa_K1506000	BBa_K1506999

We have designed a synthetic digital device inspired by electronic circuits called multiplexers. Its 3-bit memory allows saving and processing binary inputs in E. coli. Induced expression of serine recombinases, capable of specific DNA editing, enables construction of biological analogues of transistors - transcriptors - and their use as elementary memory units called SR-latches. The fourth, strobe signal resets the system to its original state. We have shown that the system could efficiently store data about previous contact with inducing sugars across hundreds of generations. This memory unit offers high sensitivity in inducer detection and signal amplification, allowing cheap induction or further development and use as a trace contaminants sensor. Eight possible output combinations, reported as RGB fluorescent proteins, may also turn out to be useful for complex coexpression research.	mradom	Marcin Radom	None	None	przem	Przemyslaw Nuc	None	None	meela;wiera;jakub;Katarzyna;osi	Melania Nowicka;Weronika Krzynowek;Jakub Bartoszewicz;Katarzyna R;ska	None	None	BBa_K1481000	BBa_K1481999

Overlap-based cloning techniques like Gibson Assembly and Circular Polimerase Extension Cloning (CPEC) have been recently becoming more and more popular. While available software allows rapid overlap design for constructs of conventional size, details of its functioning are not always fully transparent. MUFASA aims not only at facilitating the scarless cloning from the oligonucleotide design to putting the tubes into the thermocycler, but also at designing the fragments themselves in parallel with the overlaps for synthesis of big constructs de novo. Use of multiple overlaps pose a risk of non-specific hybridization and overlap “shadowing”. Such “shadowy places” may be eliminated by thermodynamic sequence optimization of both CPEC primers and fragments of the desired construct.	mradom	Marcin Radom	None	None	przem	Przemyslaw Nuc	None	None	meela;jakub;wiera;Katarzyna;osi	Melania Nowicka;Jakub Bartoszewicz;Weronika Krzynowek;Katarzyna R;ska	None	None	BBa_K1482000	BBa_K1482999

A solution is presented by utilizing synthetic biology to engineer Bacillus subtilis to increase plants’ ability to uptake iron, through production of plant phytosiderophores. Phytosiderophores are small, high-affinity iron chelating molecules that many microorganisms and plants use to increase bioavailable iron by reducing Fe3+ to Fe2+. Our genetically engineered system combines five corn genes to produce these phytosiderophores: SAMS, NAS1, NAATI, DMAS, and TOM1. We are using corn and rice to confirm that plants grown with our engineered bacteria will have higher iron content than plants grown with wild-type Bacillus or with no Bacillus at all. Mass spectrometry, chlorophyll readings, and height measurements were used to determine the effectiveness of our engineered system.	jlrickus	Jenna Rickus	None	None	kclase	Kari Clase	None	None	CThompson;hooc;svinjimo;ebenner;rwagner;pmercado;sboppana;marti762;gkuziel;haileyedmo;jcarmen;mark.aronson;jmuskat;tan114	Chris Thompson;Charlotte Hoo;Swetha K Vinjimoor;Elizabeth Benner;Ryan Wagner;Peter Mercado;Sriram Boppana;Casey Martin;Gavin Kuziel;Hailey Edmondson;Jacob Carmen;Mark Aronson;Joseph C Muskat;Tianyu Tan	soojungha;mstine	Soo Jung Ha;Janie Brennan	BBa_K1422000	BBa_K1422999

This phenomenon, termed protein splicing, allows inteins to be a point of control in forming mature and functional protein products. Current genetic circuits are limited by transcriptional lag, rendering them limited in applications which require fidelity and responsiveness. Inteins represent an innovative solution to improving the sensitivity of biosensors and synthetic circuits circumventing this lag and controlling the output of the circuit at the protein level. Here, we have created an intein toolkit, designed to introduce and facilitate the use of inteins in future iGEM projects. We have engineered several inducible intein switches capable of being activated by common environmental triggers as well as small molecules. To showcase the utility of inteins, we have also developed an intein based system to tackle mitochondria disease by allotropically expressing and transporting mitochondria proteins using inteins.	jallingham	John Allingham	None	None	None	None	None	None	matthewchan;emctay;RishadKhan;denisha.p;PTang;adrinazhong;JustineR;ymingw;MatthewBastin;adamhall;henry.barron;annie.peng;jathayde;JoannaSemrau;Kersh.T	Matthew Chan;Emily Taylor;Rishad Khan;Denisha Puvitharan;Pontius Tang;Adrina Zhong;Justine Ring;Yuming Wang;Matthew Bastin;Adam Hall;Henry Barron;Annie Peng;Jonathan Athayde;Joanna Semrau;Kersh Theva	None	None	BBa_K1435000	BBa_K1435999

Biological photovoltaics (BPVs) have the potential to provide a cheaper and more sustainable alternative, especially where energy demand is lower. They could power the social, welfare and economic growth for the 1.2 billion people without access to electricity.

These are structurally complex organic compounds that are often highly active biologically. Many pharmaceuticals are derived from or inspired by polyketides.   For the heterologous expression of polyketide synthases(PKSs), the main method of the technology is transferring full gene cluster into heterologous host strains. However, such method can’t synthetize various polyketides by the same polyketide synthase domains. This year, we are dedicated to using PKS domains as a synthetic unit to diminish the size of the target gene fragments. Meanwhile, the host strain E. coli should be genetically modified in order to enable the synthesis of the corresponding substrate. In this way, PKS domains can be assembled more quickly, enabling the programmed polyketide synthesis. In addition, we can design synthesis pathway of polyketide independently. This system can select the corresponding synthesis polyketide synthase domains to synthetize polyketide programmedly.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death around the world. Twenty-two volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been distinctly found in the breath of affected patients, creating a viable “fingerprint” for reliable detection (Horvath et al.).   This year we focused on creating biosensors for three VOCs: ethanol, formaldehyde, and xylene. We plan to create genetic circuit systems for aldB induced by ethanol, frmR recognition of formaldehyde, and xylR activated by xylene. Our current device will utilize three reporter proteins (CFP, GFP, RFP) to indicate the concentrations of the three VOCs present in an exhaled sample.  This research will eventually go into creating a conclusive test for use in the developing world.

We are pioneering the development of the first biologically-produced UAV, which will present numerous advantages over the current manufacturing paradigm. First, a foundational architecture built by cells allows for construction in almost any location and responsible disposal through biodegradation. To this end, we are synthesizing a novel cellulose acetate bioplastic, characterizing natural waterproofing proteins, and programming timed biodegradation. Second, we are leveraging synthetic biology to move costly analytic functions, which require bulky electrical components, into a cell layer with biosensing capabilities.

Our circuit utilizes catabolite repression mechanism of E coli to measure the concentration of glucose in honey. We construct plasmid Bba_J04450 by inserting either Adenylate cyclase or IIA Glc which may affect the sensitivity of catabolite repression. Creation of novel circuit which consists of constitutive promoter followed by either Adenylate Cyclase or IIAGlc genes, which placed downward lac-mRFP circuit, may affect the sensitivity of catabolite repression. We expect an engineered E coli shows red color expression in different range of glucose concentration. By changing mRFP gene with amilCP, a blue fluorescent protein, we may obtain E. coli expressing either red or blue color when different honey added to the medium due to different glucose concentration.	witarto	Arief Budi Witarto	None	None	Julmansyah;dwi;Maya	Julmansyah Julmansyah;Dwi Ariyanti;Maya Fitriana	None	None	Abdhi;fahmi;Adel;Arif;Asma;Cendra;Cindysuci;Gitafeny;Indah;Azhar;Isro;Nugrah;Rian;Yuli;Un	Abdhi Surya Perkasa;Fahmi Dwilaksono;Adelia Elviantari;Arif Muhamad;Asmawati;Cendra Harri Pahlawan;Cindy Suci Ananda;Gita Fenylestari;Indah Nurulita;Muhammad Al-Azhar;Mochammad Isro Alfajri;Nugrah Analiadi Putra;Rian Adha Ardinata;Yulianti;Yunianti	MahiMahi	Koji Sode	BBa_K1508000	BBa_K1508999

The gRNA is designed to target the relative conserved regions in HIV viral genome and inactivate its biological activity. Since viral vectors seem to be of limited use in gene therapy strategies (e.g., potential pathogenicity), there is still a need for a simple, efficient nucleic acid transfer system which allows the target-cell-specific introduction of nucleic acids. By using non-viral DNA delivery system like A-B-toxin-GAL4 fusion protein, we can deliver plasmids encoding gRNA into the helper T cells and readily attack multiple HIV genome sites simultaneously and update the targets along with our knowledge of HIV.	jiankuihe	Jiankui He	None	None	linghu_y2k	Wei Huang	None	None	azure;teng;majia67;zhangysh1995;ProfFan;dirac_sea;ChenRifei;LidanZeng;scarlett;penguin;iJayden;Gemon;Brando;Jacklelin	Jinglin Wang;Zhuoteng Peng;Yicong Tao;Yushan Zhang;Fan Jiang;Longze Su;Rifei Chen;Lidan Zeng;Sijia Liu;Mengqi Xu;Yongkang Long;Mingmeng Geng;Peng Peng;Lin Le	Hower;Rongpeng;zealotmine;cloudre37;xuhongjiao;Johnny_gong	Huiyu He;Rongpeng Li;Jia Fangxing;pei wan;HongJiao Xu;Xu Gong	BBa_K1431000	BBa_K1431999

These sequences protect cellular genomes from harmful effects associated with chromosome shortening during cell replication. Due to the finite length of telomeres, telomere shortening is known to be a primary contributor to cellular senescence and cell death. To allow human somatic cells to replicate indefinitely, we have engineered a biological circuit with three primary components to regulate telomere length. (1) Expression of the reverse transcriptase enzyme telomerase to extend telomeres (2) Regulation of the amount of telomerase expressed using an oscillatory mechanism (3) Operation of a safety device to prevent possible cancerogenesis. Through the cooperation of these three mechanisms, and the tools of synthetic biology, lifespan extension is possible.	TASTigers	Jude C.

The type II CRISPR system is a powerful mechanism in gene engineering. This system has been proved to have more efficiency than other mechanisms such as zinc finger or TALEN. However CRISPR can only function within one cell, so we use M13 phage as vector to send our CRISPR into bacteria cells to cure their resistance for M13 is a lysogenic phage.     In order to regulate our phage transduction, we use phagemid pBluescript and M13KO7 helper phage. The pBluescript contains our designed CRISPR system, it will produce CRISPR-transferd M13 phage only when a helper phage infect bacterium which have pBluescript. Then the engineered M13 phage will infect other bacteria and induce transduction of CRISPR system. Once we start the CRISPR, it will recognize and knock down the antibiotic resistance gene.	pengwoon	Peng Yeong Woon	None	None	YChing;TzuChiU_Formosa	Yung-Hao Ching;Dr. Ingrid Liu	None	None	Silver;cklittletiger;Mr.Bo;House;Peiyi;Eating;Regina	Shan, Zhe;HSIEH,SIANG-EN;CHEN SHIH JIE;Hao,Hsu;Lien PeiYi;LIN, YI-TING;CHEN YU TING	None	None	BBa_K1473000	BBa_K1473999

Each cell is an independent computational module programmed to execute instructions based on common input. They comprise bypassed toggle switches - mimicking transistors (the basis of any computational system), an interchangeable promoter serves as an input port, and a histidine kinase two-component signaling system fused to a sensor in the periplasmic domain will serve as a converter for other input signals.  The independent modules communicate using quorum sensing to produce a unified output signal.  We are chemically synthesizing a photo-switching molecule connecting the cells together, creating an artificial biofilm.

However, these “kill-switches” suffer from a fundamental flaw since they impose selective pressure on  organisms to evolve inactivation of the genetic safeguard. The activation of a kill-switch removes all individuals containing intact kill-switches from the population, leaving behind only individuals with defective kill-switches to found a new population. This project proposes an inducible plasmid-loss system to remove genetically engineered traits from a population without imposing selective pressure against the safeguard itself. The inducible plasmid-loss system is implemented by creating a plasmid containing CRISPR/Cas9, an RNA-guided nuclease system which targets and cleaves itself. A population containing this plasmid is expected to revert to wild-type upon activation. In addition to encouraging the application of evolutionary approaches to the field of synthetic biology, this project also contributes to making synthetic organisms safe for routine use outside the lab.	bsteipe	Boris Steipe	None	None	None	None	None	None	stecn;afiq_asri;guojing123;Zivit;carriehuang1993;c4Rex;Erwin;zack.tzeng;caesariscool;Shayne;VL;CharlotteMichelle;monica.akula;teto;tamstar12;Teeratham;jialunchen;ceesu;tky1119;abdiwahab.moalim;teheavy	Nadia Stec;Mohd Afiq Mohd Asri;Jing Guo;Zivit Fesler;KRUI HUANG;Xiuqi (Rex) Xia;Bohan Xing;Guang-Yo Tzeng;Matthew Paolucci;Shayne Yi-Hsien Lin;Veronica Lei;Michelle Nguyen;Monica Akula;Ingrid kao;Tamara Kleiman;Teeratham Sivieng;Jialun Tom Chen;Cathy Su;Kenneth Ting;Abdiwahab Moalim;Te Chen	samantha.chow;nvenayak;ovasquez	Samantha Chow;Naveen Venayak;Oscar Vasquez	BBa_K1559000	BBa_K1559999

A threat, originated from the fungus Ceratocystis platani, affects the gorgeous plane trees in one of the most beautiful sites in Southern France named “Canal du Midi”.     The Toulouse iGEM team is committed to protecting this UNESCO World Heritage site and has designed a bacterial cure named SubtiTree. This engineered bacterium derives from the natural Bacillus subtilis species present in the plane tree sap. SubtiTree’s mission is to detect, bind and destroy the pathogenic fungus. First, a chemotaxis module directed towards the N-Acetylglucosamine released by the fungi confers the ability to head for the pathogen. Secondly, the bacterium binds to the fungal cell wall via a chitin binding domain. The final step is to kill the pathogen using an antifungal triple therapy. Different strategies are developed to control the spreading of our smart bacterium in the environment. SubtiTree opens new perspectives to vanquish many fungal associated diseases in plants.	truan	Gilles Truan	None	None	Brice;K_Cam;meynial;Florence	Brice Enjalbert;Kaymeuang  Cam;isabelle meynial-salles;Florence Bordes	None	None	dbby;Emeline;wow91;Jourdan;Manon;cupofti;Mathieu_Fournié;FannyPineau;Florie.G;Kanitzer;Laureen	Diane Barbay;Emeline Flajollet;Abdel Touré;Jourdan Camille;Manon Molina;REITZER pierre;Mathieu Fournié;Fanny Pineau;Florie Gosseau;Aurélie Kanitzer;Laureen Mirassou	None	None	BBa_K1364000	BBa_K1364999

They especially thrive in developing countries, where the lack of advanced food storage and mycotoxin exposure causes 40% of the diseases. To lessen the problem, our team engineered E. coli strains using synthetic biology tools to produce chimeric mycotoxin-degrading fungal enzymes, Aflatoxin-Detoxifizyme (ADTZ) and Zearalenone Hydrolase (ZHD101), which are designed to be secreted to extra-cellular space by fusing with secretion signal peptides from alpha-amylase and beta-lactamase. In this study, we have successfully generated synthetic genetic materials to produce four chimeric mycotoxin-detoxifying enzymes. The levels of extracellular secretion is also characterized and analyzed. The project will allow a mass production of detoxification enzymes in cost effective way, preventing the squandering of harvested crops, and limiting mycotoxin-related diseases. Increased access to these proteins will have an immense commercial, industrial, agricultural, and health impact.	bbelyea	Brinn Belyea	None	None	None	None	None	None	bethleegy;olol909;beeread;Mokhshan;alexanderwen;ecolloid;danem;Anisa_Malangone;vicouyang;juliawisnia;Biolingual;blackbean1;Efxd3001;sepharisgold;bsmchoi;nickinikkhoy;lulupan;Erkall;ingenue	Gha Young Lee;Aidan Kahng;Brandon Read;Mokhshan Ramachandran;Alexander Wen;Daniel Sands;Dane Malangone;Anisa Malangone;Victoria Ouyang;Julia Wisnia;Michael Margolis;Kyung Eun (Christina) Baek;Edward Doyle;Melinda Wang;Sun Myung Choi;Nicki Nikkhoy;Zilu Pan;Evan Kallenberg;Ellen Ouyang	woyolee;NCsicsery;Achiral;spencerrscott;gregori523	Woo Yong Lee;Nicholas Csicsery;Jacqueline Humphries;Spencer Scott;Chang-Ho Baek	BBa_K1254000	BBa_K1254999

The oligosaccharide characterizing type O is a precursor for those characterizing types A and B. Thus, shortages of type O blood units, which can be received by people with any common ABO genotype, might be overcome by specific deglycosylation of blood units of type A, B or AB.  For this task we will utilize blood antigen-specific glycosidases in combination with different immobilisation tags. Ultimately we aim to create a matrix coated with our enzymes, able to convert blood for transfusion. Of the three enzymes we utilize, two will leave the blood compatible with all common ABO-types, while one will make the blood compatible even with the rare Bombay-blood type (Oh).  Additionally we will provide the parts-registry with new protein-tags in the RFC25 standard for fusion proteins, allowing protein-protein coupling as well as immobilization on specifically prepared matrices.

The merRNA is believed to sequester cyclic-di-GMP, much like a sponge. Since cyclic-di-GMP is a second messenger for various cellular functions, including motility and biofilm formation, the Tufts iGEM team introduced this merRNA sequence into E. coli. Constitutive expression of this merRNA transcript was shown to increase biofilm formation. This property can be useful in microbe-based approaches to environmental remediation. Earlier designs for phage delivery of the merRNA to disrupt biofilms inspired an investigation into the policy surrounding engineered bacteriophage. Tufts iGEM will be convening a panel of experts from various disciplines to put forth recommendations for the responsible use of phage in therapeutic and industrial applications.

The great innovation of our project consists on the biosensor's ability to produce a directly measurable electric signal as output. Electrical conductivity is a novel output that is orthogonal to all other standard outputs currently in use, such as fluorescence. In this way we will overcome the difficulties that arise by using conventional output signals, which are hard to quantify and to use outside the lab. The sensor-output system will be implemented in a microfluidics set-up, offering the possibility of designing a cost effective device that could  be used at a large scale.  ELECTRACE enables the interface between biology and electronics and fundamentally broadens the range of applications for synthetic biology.

To achieve this, we integrated a DNA delivery system that works in situ and a sequence-specific DNA digestion system that works in vivo.

Traditionally, in vivo directed evolution relies on physical or chemical mutagens that cause accumulation of toxic and nonspecific deleterious mutations. A novel system, termed feedback-regulated evolution of phenotype (FREP), overcomes these problems by incorporating a variable mutation rate system to mimic natural evolution. This is achieved through the dynamic control of a mutator element negatively regulated by the desired end product. The 2014 UChicago iGEM team implemented and optimized FREP in E. coli, using the tyrosine pathway as a proof of concept. We combined multiple mutators with different biases for a deeper exploration of the search space, increasing the initial mutation rate and speeding the accumulation of beneficial mutations. Eliminating mutational bias should increase sequence space search efficiency, significantly improving the process of directed evolution for industrial production of any biomolecule.	mrust	Michael Rust	None	None	None	None	None	None	RBeckner;azhangkt;esjoya;raphaeleguchi;dxixi3;ryans17;dbgasaway;rivkabk;klevinlo;analrapist	Ryan Beckner;Annie Zhang;Eliot Joya;Raphael Eguchi;Daisy Dai;Ryan Singh;Derek Gasaway;Rivka Baker Keusch;Klevin Lo;Kevin Yang	None	None	BBa_K1500000	BBa_K1500999

Azo-dyes are the main synthetic chemical colourant used in industrial manufacture of clothing, cosmetics, food, and more. During the dyeing process of materials, unbound azo-dyes are washed off into water bodies as industrial/wastewater effluent. Some azo-dyes, and their breakdown products, have proven to be of major environmental and health concern worldwide due to their mutagenic potential. The UCL 2014 team proposes harnessing various azo-dye degrading enzymes to create BioBricks for a novel Azo-Remediation Chassis (ARC). This would be capable of sensing, degrading, and decolourising azo-dyes, and ultimately detoxifying the breakdown products created. A bioprocess employing the ARC in an industrial setting has been developed and various modes of operation explored. This may serve as an end-of-pipe, lucrative addition to facilities expelling azo-dye contaminants. Furthermore, xenobiological approaches to biosafety are considered and a proposal for an “azotrophic” organism paves the way for a new era in synthetic biology biosafety.

These fibers have an extremely high range of tensile strength and elasticity, and along with their low immunogenicity, are desired by the military, medical, and fashion industries. However, spider silk farming is impractical, and alternatives are necessary for large-scale production. Inspired by nature’s design, we aim to engineer E. coli to produce genetically programmed synthetic fibers, and standardize the customization of their physical and functional properties. We have adapted Iterative Capped Assembly to modularize and flexibly control the assembly of silk domains that confer strength or elasticity in specific ratios. Varying the composition of the silk genes, or adding other functional proteins will allow precise fine-tuning of the resulting properties, and expand their practical utility. This platform can be readily applied to assemble other highly-repetitive proteins, or large genes from libraries of parts.

The project aims is to degrade microcystin, a toxic substance produced by cyanobacteria.    When cyanobacteria die, the cell walls collapse, causing the release of microcystins into water. However, microcystins happen to be extremely stable, so this means they are able to resist common chemical breakdown, such as hydrolysis, at natural conditions. It also breaks down very slowly at high temperatures (40°C), so the best way to deal with the problem is to use a bacterium that can break it down. However they aren’t usually found in water, so this allows the toxin to ravage the aquatic ecosystem.    Our idea is to make a genetically modified organism that can break down microcystins. So, we will modify an E.coli bacterium to float at the top of a water column, where the cyanobacteria are located and to detect and degrade microcystins.

Recent studies found that more than 69% of the extra virgin oil sold in US supermarkets is rancid, while no inexpensive testing method is currently available to consumers. Our team has developed a rapid, inexpensive and accurate technique to measure oil quality. We have built an electrochemical sensor that incorporates engineered enzymes to detect a spectrum of aldehydes that serve as a proxy of rancidity. Computational analysis and custom hardware that includes signal filtering, processing and optimization of chemical kinetics allows us to perform multi-compound detection and hence olive oil quality control in a highly reproducible manner.

Due to metabolic inefficiencies, canines cannot digest theobromine as quickly as humans can, thus leading to an excess of the stimulant in the gastointestinal tract. Even small amounts of chocolate can induce toxic side effects such as nausea and even death in canines. However, by manipulating theobromine via N-demethylases, it can be metabolized into xanthine, which is much safer for animal digestion. By repurposing a previously characterized caffeine degradation operon into Lactobacillus plantarum, we aim to create a probiotic that can sustain theobromine N-demethylation while simultaneously colonizing canine guts. We will also incorporate modeling with our experimental data to determine the feasibility of our novel probiotic strategy.	mmckilli	Melissa McKillip	None	None	Toddfreestone	Todd Freestone	None	None	ncornel2;syoo15;ParaSight;dkumar;andani2;gwang27;xwang167;xnspiredx;arudhir;aakaashM	Nick Cornell;SEOKCHAN YOO;Noah Flynn;Dipen Kumar;Sameer Andani;Gege Wang;Xiaodan Wang;Hans Lau;Arudhir Singh;Aakaash Meduri	xiong4	Xiong Xiong	BBa_K1380000	BBa_K1380999

A major reason for this decline is the spread of Perkinsus marinus, a protist that infests oyster cells, causing tissue damage and eventual oyster death. P. marinus infection requires recognition of a four-domain galectin protein, CvGal1, produced by oyster hemocytes to capture bacteria by binding surface sugars. P. marinus targets CvGal1 using unknown carbohydrate ligands on the protest surface. As a first step in generating a bacterial biosensor for P. marinus, a recombinant OmpA-CvGal1 protein was engineered to anchor on the E. coli outer cell membrane. OmpA fusions with mammalian two-domain galectins were similarly engineered to investigate the effect of galectin size on the efficiency of membrane display and pathogen recognition. The receptor was designed to couple to a defensive response, such as the production of anchored beta-galactosidase to cleave P. marinus recognition ligands.	bquimby	B.

When a patient is diagnosticated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in his lungs, it is too difficult to eradicate it. One reason of this it’s the biofilm generated by P. aerugunosa, which protects this opportunistic pathogen from any attack, including the treatments with antibiotics.      Our project aims to generate a bacteria capable of weakening the biofilm breaking one of the main components of this protection: the arginate; and shutting down the communication between the Pseudomonas colonies. The E. coli is capable to use the biofilms, making it a good candidate for use as a Trojan horse.

However, due to a lack of well-characterized devices capable of producing multiple states, the design of organisms with multiple changing functionalities has been hampered. This year, we have engineered yeast that can make multiple decisions based on environmental cues and indefinitely maintain their state until conditions change. We will achieve this by implementing a synthetic cellular decision making transcriptional network: the tri-stable switch. We have designed and tested new dual input promoters that use transcriptional activators as both activators and repressors. We have also generated a mathematical model of our system from our constructed promoter characterizations, along with continuing with our outreach program to elementary and high school students. We believe that by emulating cellular decision making mechanisms we will, one day, be able to manipulate existing systems.	mkaern	Mads Kaern	None	None	ianroney	Ian Roney	None	None	CStan039;ldam092;Txu;dsale017;PeterD;iharmsen;cquan040;ahulu;Y.AbouHamde;dylansiriwardena;ShizzleMcfizzle;sarah.ms93;arthanzel;ShihabS;JoeyIrani;jjose;MarinaKdsk;Nicholas;jkhaw097;uOttawaFD;bweather;dteso;AbdusA;KaitlinK;mchandrawan;lmai;huy96;SGR257;Jayn87	Cory Lefebvre;Linda Dam;Tommy Xu;Danny Salem;Peter Doan;Irene Harmsen;Curtis Quan;Alexandra Huluta;Yara Abou-Hamde;Dylan Siriwardena;Alexandra Tzahristos;Sarah Mohand-Saïd;Martin Hanzel;Shihab Sarwar;Johnathon Joey Irani;Joanne Joseph;Marina Kidisyuk;Nicholas Huang;Jenna Khawas;Fiatsogbe Dzuali;Brent Weatherall;Daniel Tesolin;Abdus Subhan Anwar;Kaitlin Kharas;Matthew Chandrawan;Lloyd Mai;Huy Minh Tran;Stephanie Maria Gran-Ruaz;Jun Yu Gao	IMaginAZN	Wilson Lam	BBa_K1400000	BBa_K1400999

So that C.crescentus can locate themselves correctly and present image colorfully.   We also found that allosteric RNA operating as riboswitch is a  promising alternative to proteins for synthetic chemical circuits due to its many distinct advantages such as rapid response and specificity.

Such memory devices include a cellular counter; a fundamental device which memorizes the number of induction events. Recent efforts have resulted in a cellular counter that can count up to three events. However, this counter cannot be reset to its initial state. Here, we propose a resettable cellular counter called “sigma recounter”. This counter utilizes the regulation system of sigma factor and anti-sigma factor as the key of its resetting mechanism. In this system a set of sigma factors are designed to update and maintain a count that responds to each inducted event. By the other stimulus, the system initiates a genetic circuit that can express a suitable set of anti-sigma factors and erases the existing memory, which will enable our device to restart the count from any state.	yw_utokyo	Yuichi Wakamoto	None	None	None	None	None	None	yoichi;Pineappler;Take.Y;naaso;OKChan;tenellus;KennyUT;Nobuhiro;naruki;mod_cocoa;Masato;cottonkitty617;kobari;yamanaka;chai;Soliton;mizinnkotaisa117;Yuewen;HajimeTakemura;carhcp1969;yumeno;Shun;cristianpenam	Yoichi Irie;Hiroki Tsuboi;Takefumi Yoshikawa;Soh Nakashima;Yoshiki Okesaku;Kento Nakamura;Kentaro Tara;Nobuhiro Hiura;Naruki Yoshikawa;Masaki Ono;Masato Ishikawa;Maiko ITO;Shigetaka Kobari;Yuto Yamanaka;Keisuke Tsukada;Manabu Nishiura;Yoshihiko Tomofuji;Yuewen Ding;Hajime Takemura;Masayuki Osawa;Yumeno Koga;Shunsuke Sumi;Cristian David Pena Martinez	None	None	BBa_K1461000	BBa_K1461999

From a single class of molecule, the terpenoids, come properties including agents with therapeutic qualities against maladies ranging from cancer to infection, antimicrobials, natural pesticides, rich flavorants, and fragrant scents. However, the utilization of these remarkable compounds has been severely hindered by their rarity in nature: many are found in only a small number of species and produced at levels measured in parts per million. Synthetic biology offers an opportunity to resolve this problem, by applying metabolic engineering in order to create cellular factories. Our project seeks to use the ideas of synthetic biology to develop a commercially viable strategy for the efficient production of a wide range of terpenoids.

Our project design is centered on the creation of BioBricks that facilitate the formation of an E.coli biofilm that captures and degrades nylon microplastics.  Biofilm formation is achieved through the overexpression of the transcriptional regulator NhaR, which increases the production of poly-beta-1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (PGA).  This exopolysaccharide creates a stable biofilm capable of adhering microplastics.  Microplastics are then degraded by manganese peroxidase and nylon hydrolase that are secreted by the biofilm.  Using these modified E. coli, our team designed a biofilter to effectively remove the threat of microplastics from water supplies.	k7koz	Keith G Kozminski	None	None	jpapin	Jason Papin	None	None	Tucker;thm4af;gem7bg;yfcbob;Chunk129;cjb5ac;Haiderinam;xy4kj;ziye;JLeehan	Matthew Tucker;Thomas Moss;Grace Mantus;Fangcheng Yuan;Alexander Schmitt;Cara Broshkevitch;Haider Inam;Xinyue Yao;Zi Ye;Joshua Leehan	Moshasha	Shaun Moshasha	BBa_K1357000	BBa_K1357999

We present a novel device that could make these processes possible: the BioNEMS Drill. This is a magnetic portion of chromatin. To construct the device we synthesized hydrophilic magnetite. We used it due to its bio-compatibility for medical applications and later functionalized them with amino groups, which can establish a peptide bond between nanoparticles and a protein. We used the HU histone-like protein, capable of coiling DNA around the nanoparticles. To get enough protein, we modified E. Coli to overexpress it. Since the core of the device is magnetic it can be controlled by applying an external magnetic field. Furthermore, the versatility of the DNA to be coated with various materials and its functionalization can selectively remove certain chemicals inside the human body such as cholesterol or toxic agents.	jluis	JOSE SANCHEZ-SALAS	None	None	ralejosmx;nanoprofe	Rubén Alejos Palomares;Miguel Mendez Rojas	None	None	Itza;SabasST;Abraham_MA_27;armando.morin;Emmanuel_IaSs;tamarasait;TaniaH;DiegoR;andigax;Ricardo_Reyes	Itza Montforte Noguez;Sabás Sánchez Tellechea;Abraham Mauleon Amieva;Armando Antonio Morin Martínez;Emmanuel Ibarra Salas;Tamara Saitcevsky Parra;Tania Cecilia Hidalgo Castillo;Diego Rosas Villalva;Andrea Díaz Gaxiola;Ricardo Reyes Valdes	None	None	BBa_K1488000	BBa_K1488999

By transforming bacteria to manufacture an enzyme that breaks down common proteins, we hope to present a new alternative to marketed removal products, which contain harsh chemicals. In theory, many enzymes could be used, varying in function to break-down different molecules such as cellulose in plant-based stains, lipids in oil stains, starches in condiment stains, and so on. However, not all enzymes can be used, as the integrity of the clothing must be preserved and the user must be kept safe from harm.  Some enzymes or solutions can cause epidermal damage or respiratory problems.  Our goal, using the enzyme subtilisin, is to remove protein-based stains and create a substitute for potent chemicals with a green solution for the 21st century.	maddoxm	Marisa Maddox	None	None	None	None	None	None	mewack18;lbuck96;erinirving;jason97;JamesZa;justinncox;VHachey;LeonM;MinaA;EdwardLo;noblecarbon;RutviBio	Mary Wack;Lauren Buckley;Erin Irving;Jason Gonsalves;James Zanghi;Justin Cox;Vanessa Hachey;Leon Mamish;Mina Antic;Edward Lo;Michael Perlow;Rutvi Bhatt	ed_wack	Edward Wack	BBa_K1259000	BBa_K1259999

Our goal therefore involved designing a bacterial system capable of detecting and binding lanthanides. We then proposed a method to extract these ions, hence making the recycling of these valuable metals (e.g. from wastewater) effective.  Basing on Salmonella iron-binding system we modified lanthanide binding tags to adjust them to different ionic size. We also used a superfolder GFP to measure the concentration  of collected ions. When an ion binds to LBT, a signalling pathway is activated, inducing fluorescence.   Our project introduces an eco-friendly retrieval technology for industrially significant elements. We hope that extracted metals will be viable for applications in electronics, including medical devices. To propose possible applications in medicine we prepared a report about some fascinating challenges in that field,  thus creating the model of Future Lantan Hospital.

In addition, the ability to regulate the level of expression of a gene using such vectors proves difficult. Therefore, we aim to create a modular, self-replicating RNA system using Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) derived RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). This drives production of siRNA directed against the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) which is elevated in type 2 diabetes and is the target of major drug studies. The replicon contains control modules, exhibiting a negative feedback mechanism provided by: an MS2 domain linked to RdRp, thereby controlling RdRp translation and therefore controlling replication, and an aptazyme switch to regulate expression levels of our siRNA. Validation of our system and the testing of modules will be performed in human (Huh 7.5) and E. coli cells.

Our team has developed a high throughput method to select for the increased expression and stability of engineered proteins, making them more amenable to large-scale production in Escherichia coli and other downstream applications. Our method involves the insertion of proteins into a Gal4-VP16 transactivator that binds a promoter directly upstream of a GFP gene. This allows for the subsequent selection of mutants associated with higher GFP output, correlating to higher stability, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Additionally, our method utilizes degrons to alter the dynamic range of this GFP output. This revolutionary method is a potentially generalizable alternative to current, labor intensive approaches for the selection of stable protein variants. Engineered proteins selected through this method could be produced in bacteria and aid in the development of thermostable, de novo protein therapeutics.	klavins	Eric Klavins	None	None	arjunkhakhar	Arjun Khakhar	None	None	stephen_rettie;efawe;anicolov;aqureshi;andychau2015;wharvey;kristanguyen;coltonomous;kevinli;kanga;acker;echang;jhl325;Harman_M;mbanjanin	Stephen A Rettie;Kevin Li;Anastasia Nicolov;Ahmed Qureshi;Andrew W.

One of the biggest causes of antibiotic resistance lies in the farming industry; more than 3 times the amount of antibiotics given to humans are administered to livestock. Over-prescription of antibiotics promotes resistance in both livestock pathogens and natural flora, which can be transmitted to humans through meat and other products.  A cheap, quick, and reliable mechanism for detecting and identifying infection is one solution to this problem. We developed an E.coli based cell surface antigen expression system that can be utilized as a diagnostic tool for nearly any viral, bacterial, or fungal infection.

We developed an anti-fouling peptide with two modular components: a mussel adhesion protein (MAP) anchor and LL-37, an antimicrobial peptide. MAPs can selectively attach to metal and organic surfaces via L-dopamine (L-DOPA), a nonstandard amino acid that was incorporated using a genomically recoded organism (GRO).  Because this peptide is toxic to the GRO in which it is produced, we designed a better controlled inducible system that limits basal expression. This was achieved through a novel T7 riboregulation system that controls expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels.  This improved system is a precise synthetic switch for the expression of cytotoxic substances in the already robust T7 system. Lastly, the antimicrobial surface-binding peptide was assayed for functionality.

The team will first determine the perception of biotechnology undergraduate students through a survey developed for this purpose.  Second, we will coordinate and conduct education and information activities with children and youth using synthetic biology activities with the goal to publicize scientific and timely information about this technology.  Finally, we will conduct a risk analysis of the E zamofordi organism by the Cartegena Protocol and the Environmental Risk Assessment of genetically modified organisms’ guidelines (ERA).  With these we will scientifically demonstrate that the project ¨Know your enemy¨ complies with the established norms of biosafety.

An Escherichia coli synthetic biology circuit for pipe repair was designed. Pipe breach detection and the restoration of pipe integrity were implemented through exploitation of chemotaxis, and cell lysis that releases a two-component protein-based glue (lysyl oxidase and tropoelastin). Control was achieved using an AND gate with quorum sensing and the lac inducer IPTG (released from the breach) as inputs. Deterministic and stochastic models of the genetic circuit, integrated with an agent-based model of E.coli cells, were used to define the effective radii of cell migration and timing of lysis. Constructed AND gate, quorum sensing and lysis timing modules were experimentally tested. The two-component glue concept was successfully validated using in vitro alpha-omega complementation of beta-galatosidase activity. Finally, a proposal for an igem.org-based parameter database was developed to aid the rapid identifation of BioBricks parameter values.	i.stansfield	Ian Stansfield	None	None	AlBrown;romano;marco_thiel;gmcoghill	Alistair JP Brown;M.

In Silico modelling tools are needed to assess the performance of artificial networks prior to assembly. Genome biofabrication must achieve rates well beyond existing methods using a modular design so that the extent to which natural systems can be made artificial can be tested. We have taken our first steps towards these goals by directing our efforts to the rational refactoring of the E. coli genome. Using flux balance analysis we have identified 117 new genes that may be essential for survival. We have developed and validated a rapid, modular biofabrication method (BioBytes) and have produced BioBytes for 150 of  our 447 essential gene list.

Our endeavor as “outsiders” is to bring our training in the arts and design to synthetic biology. Over this summer, we learnt the tools and techniques of synthetic biology and developed a piece of life which reflects our concerns, namely, the cultural, ethical and aesthetic implications of Synthetic Biology. Using a DIY approach and getting our hands “wet” was a critical element in the learning process.  Our construct synthesizes Geosmin, an enzyme normally produced by cyanobacteria and actinobacteria. The biosynthesis of geosmin from farnesyl diphosphate is catalyzed by a single enzyme germacradienol/germacrene D synthase.E. coli, does not bear a gene that codes for this enzyme. We have expressed this gene in different strains of  E. coli.

Gram-negative bacteria naturally produce outer member vesicles (OMVs): spherical, bilayered proteolipids from 20-200nm in diameter. OMVs carry outer membrane, periplasmic and cytoplasmic proteins, DNA, RNA and other biological molecules. They protect their cargo from the extracellular environment and deliver it to a multitude of target cells via membrane fusion. We investigate the possibility of allowing the secretion of any protein in OMVs via fusion with novel, non-toxic partners enhanced in OMVs, using a novel Bioscaffold compatible with the current assembly standard. A new version of the award winning BSim software has been developed to study applications at the population level such as communication. The ultimate goal is to create a safe and standardised system for directed delivery of proteins into cells.	mdiberna	Mario di Bernardo	None	None	OliverP;Krasimira;tgorochowski;thanasis;Grierson;saverynj	Oliver Purcell;Krasimira Tsaneva;Thomas Gorochowski;Athanasios Polynikis;Claire Grierson;Nigel Savery	None	None	pm5527;en5267;sr8243;pan1986;amaty;mattia.fazzini	Petros Mina;Emily Nicoli;Stephen Reid;Panayiotis Sterghides;Antoni Matyjaszkiewicz;Mattia Fazzini	chdnw;ensjh;ccolijn	Dek Woolfson;John Hogan;Caroline Colijn	BBa_K259000	BBa_K259999

We have created three software tools for these tasks. The first is a domain specific language called Eugene for the specification of biological constructs and rules for their creation. The second contribution is a visual design environment for device creation called Spectacles. Finally, we have created workflows for the Kepler design environment.

In this project we aim to control, over time and space, the production of proteins tagged with a silver-binding peptide for in situ silver nanoparticle nucleation inside microdroplets generated by microfluidic devices. Combining a transcription-translation system with protein coding genes and a recombination logic inside microdroplets provides spatial control. Moreover, in the microfluidic chamber we can pinpoint the beginning of synthesis, and easily track and isolate the droplets. Site-specific recombination generates a molecular timer for temporal control of protein synthesis. Unlike transcriptional regulation, this method gives true all-or-none induction due to covalent modification of DNA by Flp recombinase. Determining the transfer curve of inter-FRT site distance versus average recombination time allows the onset of gene expression to be predicted. We then apply this Flp reporter system as a powerful PoPS measurement device.	pschwil	Petra Schwille	None	None	kaj;epp	Kaj Bernhardt;Eugene Petrov	None	None	stanley;divyail;priyankas;grushina;arnabbt;Tomek;dherde;dmenon	Stanley Dinesh;Divya Ail;priyanka sharma;Anja Grushina;Arnab Sen;Tomasz Sadowski;Daniel Herde;Deepikaa Menon	Sal9000;ilaria.visco;royerloic	Salvatore Loguercio;Ilaria Visco;Loic Royer	BBa_K260000	BBa_K260999

A BioBrick gene-independent control of translation	The project aims to realize a device with standard biological parts for the post-transcriptional control of gene expression, regardless of the gene sequence to be silenced. We designed the T-REX device, composed of two non-coding DNA sequences: the TRANS-repressor and the CIS-repressing parts. TRANS-repressor acts as a silencer of CIS-repressing RNA target. This target includes a region complementary to the TRANS-repressor sequence antisense, ends with RBS, and is assembled upstream of the coding sequence to be silenced. Upon binding of TRANS-repressor and CIS-repressing RNAs, the access to RBS by ribosomes is hampered, silencing translation. Accordingly, the amount of TRANS-repressor controls the translation rate of the regulated gene. The TRANS-repressor sequence was determined by a computational analysis performed to minimize the interference with the genomic mRNAs and to maximize the base-pairing interaction to the CIS-repressing RNA.  The T-REX device is proposed as a universal and fast switch in synthetic gene circuits.	silvio.cavalcanti	Silvio Cavalcanti	None	None	francesca ceroni;MarcoBo;simone.furini;marina.lalatta;hochko	francesca ceroni;marco caprini;Simone Furini;marina lalatta;Alejandro Hochkoeppler	None	None	Marilisa;andrea.samore;elisa.passini;Marco_Marchetti_Bo;Alessandro.Tornani;marco.cavina;Pierluigi.Stallone	Marilisa Cortesi;Andrea Samoré;Elisa Passini;Marco Marchetti;Alessandro Tornani;Marco Cavina;Pierluigi Stallone	e-man;giulio.zanaroli	Emanuele Giordano;Giulio Zanaroli	BBa_K201000	BBa_K201999

Our system design utilizes RNA-level hairpin hybridization and antisense technologies linked to various reporters.  Because our approach is modular and does not depend on either endogenous protein processing or exogenous RNA, we envision that such a system could find applications in many different fields, including environmental sensing, detection of diagnostic of therapeutic biomarkers, and systems biology.	lagally	Eric Lagally	None	None	None	None	None	None	ericmjl;alexhmng;hkemp;MarkXL;CalvinChan89;ahardjasa;hankyu;labmouse90;Karen;geoffw;chowes;daydreamer	Eric Ma;Alex Ng;Heather Kempthorne;Mark Xiao Ling;Calvin Chan;Amelia Hardjasa;Hang Yu;Alan Tung;Karen Cheshire;Geoffrey Woollard;Charles Howes;Janny Xuechen Ke	peej	Paul Jaschke	BBa_K206000	BBa_K206999

We are putting the rEV131 gene into an endogenous element of human nasal flora, Staphylococcus epidermidis. rEV131 will have a secretion tag specific for S. epidermidis. To synchronize rEV131 production with elevation of histamine concentration, we are computationally designing a novel histamine receptor. This histamine-responsive receptor will induce expression of rEV131. Although S. epidermidis is a non-pathogenic species, when it reaches a certain population threshold it produces potentially hazardous biofilms. To mitigate this concern, we have engineered safety measures that prevent excessive growth by repurposing S. epidmidis’ natural population sensor to cue each cell’s ""suicide"" when a population has reached a dangerous size."	areich	Adrian Reich	None	None	djd;rhet	Diana J.

The design has been generated with sustainability in mind, and aims to create an alternative to traditional fossil fuel technologies. The battery owes its capabilities to two strains of bacteria: the heterotroph Rhodoferax ferrireducens, and the photoautotroph Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Each strain will occupy its own concentration cell and after being cultured anaerobically, will either oxidize (in the case of R. palustris) ferris iron or reduce (in the case of R. ferrireducens) ferric iron. The resulting current will be collected and used to demonstrate the functionality of the battery. The reduction and oxidation reaction will be self-substaining. This process is further aided by the genetic modification of R. palustris. As a photosynthetic prokaryote, R. palustris generates glucose readily.

We have sought to engineer a bacterium able to detect TNT and its degradation products, nitrites, in the environment. Our system is based around a previously published computationally designed TNT-sensing protein derived from the periplasmic ribose binding protein, which interacts with an EnvZ-Trg transmembrane hybrid fusion protein and a nitrite-responsive repressor to trigger a pathway of TNT degradation and visualization using combined output from a bacterial luciferase and Yellow Fluorescent Protein. We envisage that the detection system could be applied by spraying the organism on soil where the presence of landmines is suspected, and detecting luminescence using low-light sensing. Once located, the mines could be safely removed. This system could be extended to detect other analytes in the environment.	cfrench	Chris French	None	None	aelfick	Alistair Elfick	None	None	Darya;Vasilis;evangelineoh;dzonni;winho88;Rachel;JuliaS;clonerohin	Darya Ausiannikava;Vasilis Andreou;Evangeline Oh;Jan Domozilov;Winston Ho;Rachel Morrison;Julia Skripka;Rohin Koolwal	None	None	BBa_K216000	BBa_K216999

Colight	Recent discoveries of photoreceptors in many organisms have given us insights into the interest of using light-responsive genetic tools in synthetic biology. The final goal of our project is to induce a change in gene expression, more specifically to turn a gene on or off, in a living organism, in response to a light stimulus. For this we use light-sensitive DNA binding proteins (or light-sensitive proteins that activate DNA binding proteins) to convert a light input into a chosen output, for example fluorescence, through a reporter gene such as RFP. Demonstrating that the light-induced gene switch tool works in vivo would show that easier and faster tools can potentially be made available in several fields of biology, as such tools can induce more localized, more precise (time resolution and reversibility) and drastically faster genetic changes than currently used ones, thus allowing research to evolve even better.	groovescience	Bart Deplancke	None	None	calou;nicko;maerkl;naefix	Carine Gubelmann;Nicolas Denervaud;Sebastian Maerkl;felix naef	None	None	pregerni;nbranden;ngobet;cadamczy;cbaer;nltt1987;guittet;hfournier;bwicky;rpennese	Gabriela Pregernig;Nathalie Brandenberg;Nicolas Gobet;Christian Adamczyk;Caroline Baer;Le Thanh Tu NGUYEN;Mélanie Guittet;Heidi Fournier;Basile Wicky;Rafael Pennese	None	None	BBa_K191000	BBa_K191999

Yet, constraints of limited sequence length and variation recognized by available restriction enzymes pose a major roadblock for synthetic biology. We developed the basis for universal restriction enzymes, primarily for routine cloning but also with potential for in-vivo applications. We use a nucleotide cleavage domain fused to a binding domain, which recognizes a programmable adapter that mediates DNA binding and thus cleavage. As adapter we use readily available modified oligonucleotides, as binding domain anticalins, and as cleavage domain FokI moieties engineered for heterodimerization and activity. For application, this universal enzyme has merely to be mixed with the sequence-specific oligonucleotide and the target DNA. Binding and release are addressed by thermocycling. We provide concepts for in-vivo applications by external adapter delivery and activity regulation by photo switching. Additionally, an argonaute protein is engineered towards a DNA endonuclease.

Due to contaminated food and water, humans are at risk for Methemoglobinemia caused by enterohepatic metabolism of nitrates into ammonia. This process also oxidizes the iron in hemoglobin, rendering it unable to carry oxygen. Infants in particular are susceptible to Methemoglobinemia, also known as “Blue Baby Syndrome”, when formula is reconstituted using contaminated water. In order to prevent Methemoglobinemia, it is essential to detect high concentrations of nitrates. Fnr-NarG is an aerobic mutation of the nitrogen-sensitive promoter NarG that was provided by Dr. Lindow at UC Berkeley. By combining Red Fluorescent Protein with an aerobic mutant strain of NarG, the creation of Red Fluorescent Nitrate Detector (RFND) is possible. RFND is economically efficient because of its ability to self-replicate.

To battle this problem, a purification strategy was developed in which arsenic, zinc or copper are removed from metal-polluted water and sediment. In this approach Escherichia coli bacteria accumulate metal ions from solutions, after which they produce gas vesicles and start floating. This biological device encompasses two integrated systems: one for metal accumulation, the other for metal-induced buoyancy. The uptake and storage system consists of a metal transporter and metallothioneins (metal binding proteins). The buoyancy system is made up of a metal-induced promoter upstream of a gas vesicle gene cluster. This device can be changed to scavenge for any compound by altering the accumulation and the induction modules. The combination of both systems enables the efficient decontamination of polluted water and sediment in a biological manner.	oscarkuipers	Oscar Kuipers	None	None	None	None	None	None	Jelle;verhoeven1981;Wilfred;svenjurgens;nienke;jaspervdg;PaulSchavemaker;JolandaWitteveen;kbover;Frans;Annelies	Steven Jelle Meijer;Michael Verhoeven;Wilfred Poppinga;Sven Jurgens;Nienke Kuipers;Jasper van de Gronde;Paul Schavemaker;Jolanda Witteveen;Klaas Bernd Over;Frans Bianchi;Annelies van Keulen	None	None	BBa_K190000	BBa_K190999

However, it is virtually unknown between unicellular organisms, much less between unicellular organisms of different kingdoms of life. Our team has constructed a system that allows for interspecies, bacteria-to-yeast optical communication. To permit bacteria to send an optical signal, we expressed in E. coli a red firefly luciferase under IPTG induction. In yeast, we used a yeast-two-hybrid-system based on the interaction between the red-light-sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana phytochrome PhyB and its interacting factor PIF3. Interaction between PhyB and PIF3 is induced by the red light from the bacteria, resulting in transcription of the lacZ gene. This is an excellent demonstration of the principles and potential of synthetic biology: this system not only allows for interspecies optical communication, but enables us to optically bridge a physically separated canonical lac operon using light as a trans-acting factor.	tamarabrenner	Tamara Brenner	None	None	Oliver;jvshah;dbbttt;AVIEL;jjocz;Geochurch	Oliver Medvedik;jagesh Shah;David Thompson;Alain Viel;Jennifer Jocz;George Church	None	None	neena;gosiad0;agoyal;xguane;amraman;ibochkov	Neena Kamath;Malgorzata Dymerska;Amrita Goyal;Xin Guan;Anugraha Raman;Ivan Bochkov	None	None	BBa_K207000	BBa_K207999

Promoters are the fundamental elements of every synthetic biological system. We have developed and successfully applied two novel, in silico guided methods for the rational construction of synthetic promoters which respond only to predefined transcription factors. Thus, we have been able to create a library of promoters of different strength and inducibility. To characterize the promoters, we have developed standardized protocols for comparable measurements of promoter strength by either transient or stable transfection. These synthetic promoters can be used as “spybricks” which enable the construction of assays for simultaneously monitoring several pathways in a cell. However, the potential of synthetic promoters goes far beyond this application: e.g. in virotherapy, these promoters could be used for selective gene expression in target cells.	jenskeienburg	Jens Keienburg	None	None	danielarichter;PhillipH;yreis;mbernardo;akranz;tbauer	Daniela Richter;Phillip Hundeshagen;Yara Reis;Marti Bernardo Faura;Anna-Lena Kranz;Tobias Bauer	None	None	Simonhaas;MichaelBartoschek;naoiwamoto;stephenkraemer;chenchenzhu;hannahuckelmann;biji;Chiller;DouaaM.;Titus;larsplus;aradema3;HannahMeyer	Simon Haas;Michael Bartoschek;Nao Iwamoto;Stephen Krämer;Chenchen Zhu;Hannah Uckelmann;Bingqing Zhao;Corinna Hiller;Douaa Mugahid;Tim Heinemann;Lars Velten;Anne Rademacher;Hannah Meyer	Reichen;reils	Michaela Reichenzeller;Roland Eils	BBa_K203000	BBa_K203999

Our 'bio-motor' aims to breach this gap to bring a foundational advancement. In our model, Escherichia coli cells are engineered to specifically express streptavidin at pole(s), which allows cells to adhere in the same orientation to a microrotary motor through biotin-streptavidin interaction. Thus, with the propulsion generated by bacterial flagella, this synthetic device is capable to convert biological energy into mechanical work. Furthermore, the propulsion energy was programmed to be adjustable by controlling E.coli swimming speed, i.e. putting E.coli cheZ gene under the control of ptet. This technology has tremendous potential to be applied in various fields including biomedicine, bio-energy, and bioengineering.

This strain would serve as an environmental-friendly substitute for pesticides. The idea is demonstrated by constructing an odorant sensing module, coupled production of chemical attractant and production of pest-killing binary toxin in yeast to kill pests lured to the yeast culture. A chimera G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) responsive to an odorant chemical is coupled to the yeast mating pathway that can be activated upon ligand binding.  It leads to over-expression of an endogenous yeast transaminase that catalyzes a reaction to yield 2-phenylethanol.  Constitutively expressed binary toxin in the yeasts would poison the attracted pests after their consumption, as tested by feeding drosophilae. In addition to being a pesticide substitute, this cheaply-maintained engineered yeast strain also serves as a research reagent to screen for GPCRs that bind to certain ligands.	kinglchow	King L.

Building complex genetic circuits in a single cell becomes difficult due to the formidable task of co-transforming large nucleotide sequences in addition to the imposed metabolic burden on the cell. Can a complex system be divided into independent modules that reside in different cells and interact with each other using nucleotide and protein mediated cell-cell signalling to act as a single unit? We seek to address this problem using a three pronged approach. Firstly, we are trying to introduce natural competance genes into the biobrick framework which will act as nucleotide importers. We are also building a protein export system using the TAT dependent export pathway. Finally, we are attempting to construct a multi-state turing machine which is a compound, modular computational system that has independent, interacting states which applies the above principle.

The showpiece of the project is the feedback mechanism. Vanillin synthesis is initiated by irradiation with blue light. The preferred concentration can be modulated using the intensity of that light. At the same time the bacterium measures the amount of vanillin outside the cell and controls its production to maintain the set point. The designed system is universal in nature and has therefore potential benefits in different areas. The concept can easily be applied to other flavours and odours. In fact, any application that requires a constant concentration of a molecular substance is possible.	ingethijs	Inge Thijs	None	None	sigriddk;Hanne;Zeunas;maarten;Dries;david1	Sigrid De Keersmaecker;Hanne Tytgat;Jonas Demeulemeester;Maarten Breckpot;Dries Vercruysse;david de coster	None	None	K3n;watcher;MarianC.;bvanpary;Bart_Bosmans;AnneV;Maxime;deepstar;karen1205;JochemDeen;JorenDR;didierborowski	Katrien Mols;Bernard Siebens;Marian Crabbé;Bart Van Parys;Bart Bosmans;Annelien Verfaillie;Maxime Deforche;Steven Van Acker;Karen Leirs;Jochem Deen;Joren De Raeymaecker;Didier Borowski	astrid.cappuyns;kmarchal;moreau;Johan;ke;lyn_venken;johncreemers;AGeeraerd;sofies;BDM;joris	Astrid Cappuyns;Kathleen Marchal;Yves Moreau;Johan Robben;Kristof Engelen;Lyn Venken;John Creemers;Annemie Geeraerd;Sofie Saerens;Bart De Moor;Joris Winderickx	BBa_K238000	BBa_K238999

The ultimate goal is to build a micromachine sensing and determining of the concentration of heavy metals in a sample solution (e.g. the waste water). In order to design the system, we will employ two fluorescence proteins (GFP and RFP) and aryl acylamidase as signal reporters. Since each heavy metal promoter produces unique fluorescence or color by those reporters, if more than two heavy metals coexist in a solution, the results would be interpreted from the convoluted fluorescence and/or color rather than a single signal detection. The successful construction of the synthetic modules in E. coli can be utilized in the form of a lyophilized powder, which can be stored in a drug capsule to make it portable.	igchoi	In Geol Choi	None	None	khekim;ischang2005;kgoh	Kyoung Heon Kim;In Seop Chang;Kwang-Il Goh	None	None	Cheolwon.choi;roh329;jihui;yeonjin;Ginger;totoro46;KUglycine;SiminKim;ironmon;bys131	Cheolwon Choi;Hanseong Roh;jihui jang;Yeonjin Kong;Kina Jeon;Yoonzi Kim;Jihye Shin;Simin Kim;cheolwoo lee;Yung seol Byun	None	None	BBa_K271000	BBa_K271999

The first is “GSDD”, the project to make a ""time bomb""---a unique system to control the time of cell death.  We create timer mechanism by taking advantage of the end-replication problem and the protecting effect of lacI (bound to each end of DNA) against exonuclease digestion.  As the cell divides, due to the end-replication problem, the ""timer"" DNA gets shorter, and eventually, the repressor expression level falls.  Then the downstream killer gene becomes expressed. The other one, “Cells in Cells” is the project to make a cell.  We defined making cells as making liposomes that can divide like mitochondria do.  To approach our goal, we set two subgoals.  One is to enable cells to take in liposomes.  The other is to enable the liposomes to import proteins needed for mitochondrial division.  We suppose this could be the first step to create artificial cells."

Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) use biological systems to produce an electrical current.  Cyanobacteria are organisms which have been studied in MFCs and have been found to create a current, although not highly efficient (Tsujimura et al., 2001).  We wish to increase the efficiency of the cyanobacteria MFC by introducing microcompartments to create a BioBattery.  The microcompartments are created by the production of the protein lumazine synthase forms icosahedral capsids.   As a proof of principle we will create this system within Escherichia coli and target two different fluorescent proteins within the microcompartment to observe fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Furthermore, we will be exploring a novel method for the mass production of uniform nanoparticles, which is more efficient and cost effective than current methods.

We investigated a simple representational intercellular signaling network where a population of cells synthesizes and secretes an activator molecule capable of activation a second population of cells into synthesizing and secreting an inhibitor molecular which feeds back and inhibits the production of the activating molecule.  This is known as an activation-inhibition system.  We began by using a partial differential equation model of the system to explore the effect of varying the separation distance of the two populations of cells.  We found that three types of dynamics were present: steady states, periodic oscillations, and quasi-periodic oscillations.  We further designed two strains of E. coli capable of interacting with each other as an activation-inhibition system and endeavored to validate our modeling results in a biological system.	fnaqib	Faisal Naqib	None	None	Nadeau;leonglass	Jay Nadeau;Leon Glass	None	None	TDQuail;horiavulpe;lmusa	Thomas Quail;Horia Vulpe;Louai Musa	None	None	BBa_K290000	BBa_K290999

Through spills and improper disposal, toluene can contaminate soil and ground water environments.  Using microorganisms to clean up toluene-contaminated sites can be an effective and economical way of degrading the pollution before it can spread throughout the environment. There is concern, however, that these non-native microorganisms may upset the balance of the ecosystem through unnatural competition or horizontal synthetic gene transfer. We are engineering the Toluene Terminator as a way to neutralize toluene pollution while addressing these concerns. It will have the capabilities of sensing and mineralizing the toluene into carbon dioxide and water, but this terminator will not be back.

Our project involves engineering S. cerevisiae to localize proteins to various points in the cell in response to light exposure. Under red light, a tagged protein of interest localizes to a specific target, while exposure to far-red light causes the protein to rapidly delocalize and diffuse throughout the cell. This is accomplished using the PhyB-PIF3 system, a light-based transcriptional regulation system found in Arabidopsis.  This project has two components. 1) Metabolically engineering yeast to endogenously produce PCB, a tetrapyrrole necessary for system activation, and 2) adapting the PhyB-PIF3 system to localize proteins of interest to different targets in the cell.  The versatility and applications for this system are vast, ranging from cellular diffusion studies to easily synchronizing cell division for entire populations.	narendra	Narendra Maheshri	None	None	nkuldell;kristalaprather	Natalie Kuldell;Kristala Jones Prather	None	None	bross;LiS;dmcdona;alied	Brian Ross;Cory Li;Dominic McDonald;Alexandra Doolittle	scottmc;chiaywu;sjg;bbelmont;shawnfm;nck;tto;tsmoon;jcwagner	Scott Carlson;Chia-Yung Wu;Stephen Goldfless;Brian Belmont;shawn finney-manchester;Nathan Klapoetke;T.L.

The circuit works as an OR gate to integrate temporal and environmental signals. The output (red fluorescent protein: RFP) of the OR gate is ON when one of the input signals is ON. The timer function is controlled by Lac promoter, and the concentration of lactose determines timer’s working length. After added lactose is consumed by E. coli, the RFP will be translated to remind us that time’s up. The counter function can detect the bacteria population with LuxI/LuxR device; moreover, the counter sensitivity is controlled by the strength of TetR repressible promoter. If external bacteria invade the system, the extra AHL produced by them will induce the RFP translation to warn us the contamination. Our project can be applied to storage warning signs of fresh food, contact lens, and wound dressing.

Germination of the spores can be disabled, making retrieval of the cadmium unnecessary since they can persist intact for thousands of years. We computationally simulated the life cycles of individual cells and entire cell populations, to estimate the parameter values necessary to maintain sustainable populations of sporulating, germinating and vegetative cells.

None	Collegiate	iGEM	Europe	FRANCE	Unspecified	None	 Foundational Advance	Message in a Bubble: a robust inter-cellular communication system based on outer membrane vesicles.	Sending a message across the ocean… Outer membrane vesicles (OMV), naturally produced by gram negative bacteria as E. Coli, are strong candidates for long-distance messaging. Our engineered communication platform consists of controlling OMV production by destabilizing membrane integrity through over-expression of specific periplasmic proteins (e.g., TolR). In order to control and modulate message content, we used fusions with OmpA signal sequence and the ClyA hemolysin as delivery tags. A targeting system was developed, based on the outer-membrane expression of Jun/Fos leucine zippers to control the vesicle flux between donor and recipient cells. Once received, the signal from incoming vesicles is transduced through a modified Fec pathway, whereby the receptor is provided by the OMV.

We have constructed and tested a series of AND gates which can sense the two signals: the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli. With the presence of both signals, the AND gate outputs a repressor protein and then changes the state of the bistable switch, which acts as a memory module. In this way, our E. coli cells can convert the information about the concurrence of the two signals into its memory. After the memory module is switched and given the ""conditioned stimulus"", the E. coli cells will pass the information to the reporter module and thus exhibit the ""conditioned response."""

To date, it has been difficult to overcome primary brain cancer resulting from GBM, primarily because the cancer-initiating cells are suspected to be highly resistant to current cancer therapies. Specifically, CD133+ cells have shown resistance to hypoxia, irradiation, and some forms of chemotherapy. CD133+ hunting machines will be created by genetically engineering microglial cells (BV-2) with mammalian expression vectors. The project will also take advantage of inherent qualities of the microglia such as constant environmental sensing and quick motility. The engineered BV-2s will be equipped to locate the specific GBMs and label the targeted cells with a tat-GFP fusion protein. It is the goal of this study to show an alternative approach to cancer treatment, and to emphasize the power of biologically available options to fight the disease.	jlrickus	Jenna Rickus	None	None	cbarcus	Craig Barcus	None	None	mstine;cberrios;nisch;bfawaz;jbretzma;kgharris;dcrakes;ksood;eplascak;rmgupta;jessamine;vwilson;ma0	Janie Brennan;Christian Berrios;Noah Isch;Bradley Fawaz;Joe Bretzmann;Katharine Harris;Dale Crakes;Kaneeka Sood;Elizabeth Plascak;Ritika Gupta;Jessamine Pilcher;Venecia Wilson;Sung Jun Ma	kclase	Kari Clase	BBa_K217000	BBa_K217999

Currently, treatment for atherosclerosis involves preventative measures and surgical removal of plaque, angioplasty, and stent placement. We sought to develop an E. coli chassis delivering anti-atherosclerotic substances to the site of plaque in vasculature. Inflamed endothelial cells express VCAM-1, a receptor normally binds to the leukocyte antigen VLA-4. We attempted to express a VLA-4 fragment in E. coli, in order to selectively attach the cells to plaques. In vitro binding test uses inflamed murine endothelial cells which express VCAM-1. Results are pending. Our bacterial chassis also carries several inducible “effector” systems which, upon binding, release substances that facilitate plaque stabilization and regression. Effector systems include heme oxygenase-1, serum amyloid A and atrial natriuretic peptide. Expression of HO-1 in E. coli has been confirmed using spectroscopy. Testing for SAA secretion and ANP-induced gene expression in endothelial cells is ongoing.	greerp	Peter Greer	None	None	Virginia;chinsang;DLeBrun;WS4	Virginia K.

Aureus Biofilm Formation, One Peptide at a Time	Our goal is to create an E. coli strain, which inhibits Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation in wounds by producing RNA III-inhibiting-peptide (RIP). S. aureus is one of the largest causes of hospital infections, each year infecting millions of people around the globe. S. aureus is normally commensal, but can create biofilms on implanted medical devices and in post-operational wounds. Biofilm is increasingly hard to treat, as a result of growing resistance to many types of antibiotics. By manipulating E. coli to express a synthetic RIP peptide tagged with an export signal, we hope to reach this goal. RIP has been shown to hinder the quorum-sensing processes essential for biofilm development in S. aureus, thereby making it harder for the bacteria to cause infections. We propose making a bandage that contains our engineered bacteria behind a semipermeable membrane, allowing only small peptides such as RIP to pass through, into the wound.

Coli Switch	By modifying E.coli so that it can use a phytochrome- with a light receptor- from cyanobacteria as a trigger of protein generation. This pathway is controlled by a certain wavelength of red light, acting as a system switch for lacZ production. LacZ can react with substrate X-gal and form a blue precipitate as a reporter. However, other reporter genes can be attached to the lacZ gene, so different reporters can be expressed. From the fact that this mechanism is sensitive to a certain wavelength of light, we hope to create a system that can be sensitive to various wavelengths and hence triggering different protein generation. Through this the E.coli can become a wavelength sensor; a different wavelength can trigger a different production of protein, for example various types of fluorescent protein, giving a different a colour-scaled indication of the wavelength of the environment around the E.coli.	pcwsynbio	Phillip C Wright	None	None	visakan	Visakan Kadirkamanathan	None	None	kirubhakaran;enememily	kirubhakaran krishnanathan;Man Ting Kwong	Dmitry;Tara;Samuel;Jags	Dmitry O.

The relE protein?toxin?, is an RNase that preferentially cleaves mRNA stop codons, severely inhibiting translation and preventing colony formation. Whereas expression of relB protein?antitoxin? and tmRNA forms a rescue system to reverse inhibitory effects. Based on these mechanisms our network functions as a bacterial bioclock oscillating between the two states of dormancy and activity. Potential applications of our project include lifespan prolongation of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, since the metabolic process of microbes is vastly decelerated during the dormancy state, just like that of bears and hedgehogs in their hibernation.	helin	Lin He	None	None	chenfeng2001;ccwei;magang;qsy	Feng Chen;Chaochun Wei;Gang Ma;Shengying Qin	None	None	songting858;muller;Jessienn;pnstontale;kermit_tao;treetty;wuchudavid;yolanda;fish;Psychrophile;silviayan;nothingletitled;Sabrina;xlxkxcc;Anything;Dennis*C	Songting Li;Shikun Zhao;Zhou Neng Yi;Heng Luo;Yixin Tao;Shu Wang;Chu Wu;Chen Yan;Ruoyu Xing;Shuai Wang;Chenxing Yan;Lei Jiang;Tang Yun;Xu Liang;Zhe Shen;Han Zhu	None	None	BBa_K185000	BBa_K185999

We have two systems that correspond the game ³Rock, Paper, Scissors² (RPS) and to Conway¹s ³Game of Life² (GoL). In GoL expression/diffusion of lactones is exploited to create local rules that modulate expression of a fluorescent protein. Fluorescence patterns for different combinations of conditions are modelled using a new simulation tool designed to be generically applicable to inter-bacterial communication. In the RPS system three 'species' each produce a different fluorescent protein whose expression is downregulated by a lactone from one of the other 'species' and hence the interaction network is intransitive. Simulations indicate that when this game is played out on culture plates, a range of complex patterns evolve with time. Also, selective patterning of the different 'species' allows for new 'racetrack' or 'playing field' type of interactivity.

The Stanford team has applied synthetic biology to a longstanding objective of immunotherapy: restoration and maintenance of homeostasis.  Stanford’s Escherichia coli-based probiotic will polarize T cell differentiation along antagonistic fates - immunosuppressive Treg and inflammatory Th17 phenotypes - in response to local conditions.  Our device design consists of two parts: one that modulates deleterious Treg-driven immunosuppression and another that engages Th17-mediated inflammation.  Through specific sensors and effectors, therapy will oscillate between dampening pathologic inflammation and immunosuppression until a balance in the local T cell population is achieved.  Securing such homeostasis between these populations has therapeutic implications for autoimmune disorders like IBD, HIV and cancer. We envision our novel and directed probiotic therapy for IBD as acting at the interface between commensal bacteria and human lymphocytes, integrating cutting-edge immunology with synthetic biology.	drew	Drew Endy	None	None	isist;Lawrencesteinman;caltechigem;mcyert	Isis Trenchard;Lawrence steinman;Christina Smolke;Martha S.

Whatsoever its nature, the vector encounters many problems : Stability, targeting, membrane passage, and the immune response. Therefore, we tried to achieve the ideal vector, being the most stable as possible, can easily penetrate its targets, and outwit the immune system. We have created a double vectorization system, by using jointly a bacteria and a phage. The first vector which is bacterial, will target the tissue, and resist to the immune system. The second vector is a phage, will be used for cell targeting and  membrane penetration.  The combination of the two systems improves the intrinsic abilities of vectors, and offers new possibilities for applications.	More...	More...

In ESCAPES, the first green light flash induces the E. coli to self-aggregate, while the second flash causes them to auto-lyse, thus greatly simplifying the protein preparation process. The light-activated actuator was constructed by fusing the light responsive domain of the Synechocystis photoreceptor CcaS with the EnvZ histidine kinase domain. Self-aggregation is achieved by the induction of the Antigen43 gene, which we isolated from E. coli, while autolysis took advantage of the available BioBrick parts endolysin and holin.

Organophophates (OPs) are highly toxic compounds used as pesticides and chemical ware-fare agents around the world, including sarin, soman, and VX gas.  To combat these toxins, which act as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, we designed a highly efficient whole-cell S. cerevisiae sensor and biocatalyst system for the detection and remediation of the model organophosphate compound paraoxon and its degradation products.  For our biosensor device, reporter constructs were incorporated into the genome downstream of paraoxon and paraoxon-hydrolyis sensitive promoters. Our degradation device was designed in three parts, targeting paraoxon through expression of organophosphate hydrolase from Flavobacterium, sp and two of its degradation byproducts p-nitrophenol and diethyl phosphate. Each device was genomically integrated in order to bypass selective the need for selective condition, while the degradation devices were constitutively expressed for maximum efficiency. Combined, this two-part system allows for both the detection and remediation of a broad range of common and deadly neurotoxins.	skron	Stephen Kron	None	None	None	None	None	None	norayucel;blee1989;rekang;tluo88;RMcConeghy;damonwang	Nora Yucel;Brandon Lee;Ryeo Eun Kang;Tony Luo;Rob McConeghy;Damon Wang	Satoe	Satoe Takahashi	BBa_K268000	BBa_K268999

Our product and system is called “the traffic-light stress sensor”. It is constructed to express fluorescent proteins of different colors in response to different stimuli which are inhibiting growth or harming production. We aim to build a sensor that can detect shear stress and low oxygen levels. We believe these two stresses are critical in a bioprocessing environment. We are applying e.coli’s native or modified promoters for DegP, Spy and NarK in order to induce transcription. Ideally the cells responses to stressed conditions should be sufficiently accurate, reliable and rapid for the stresses to be detected and mitigated.	ucbekkm	Eli Keshavarz-Moore	None	None	Johnward;DNesbeth	John Ward;Darren Nesbeth	None	None	Navidchy;axelnystrom;anike;zcbcd06;PierreB	Navid Ashraf Choudhury;Axel Nystrom;Anike Akinrinlade;Xiang Chen;Pierre Beniguel	None	None	BBa_K239000	BBa_K239999

This behavior, known as chemotaxis, is a fundamental biological process crucial to such diverse functions as development, wound healing and immune response. Our project focuses on using a synthetic biology approach to manipulate signaling pathways that mediate chemotaxis. We are attempting to reprogram the movements that the cells undergo by altering the guidance and movement machinery of these cells in a modular way. For example, can we steer them to migrate toward new signals? Can we make cells move faster? Slower?  We hope to better understand how chemotaxis works, and eventually build cells that can perform useful tasks.

To solve this problem, the aim of our project is to engineer strains of the industrial workhorses E. coli and S. cerevisiae to recognize and destroy contaminants. The engineered yeast will recognize lactic acid bacteria contaminants, which greatly affect Brazilian´s ethanol production. The presence of lactic acid will activate a lysozyme-based killing mechanism, effective against gram-positive contamination. The engineered E. coli will recognize contaminants based on a non-self recognition mechanism and a percentage of the population will differentiate into a killing lineage releasing colicins and endonucleases. The killing mechanisms will be regulated by promoter Py, probably activated by conjugation.

Even if  whey can be valorized by extracting high value substances, like whey-proteins, at the end of the treatment the residual liquid is still a special waste for its high lactose content (4%). E. coli was engineered to convert efficiently lactose into ethanol, a precious biofuel. Three main enzymes are involved in this transformation: beta-galactosidase, pyruvate-decarboxylase and alcohol-dehydrogenaseII. Beta-galactosidase (lacZ gene) was over-expressed to obtain higher lactose-glucose conversion yield. Coding sequences  of pyruvate-decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol-dehydrogenaseII (adhB), essential in alcoholic fermentation pathway, were designed by DNA chemical synthesis and codon-optimized for E. coli. The final circuit includes the device to metabolize lactose and the ethanol-producing operon, containing pdc and adhB. It has a theoretical yield of 20kilos/tons of whey. Finally, 3OC6HSL, aTc and lactose/IPTG inducible systems were characterized to be used in this circuit.	magni	Paolo Magni	None	None	Cusella	Cusella Gabriella	None	None	Giulio86;110hs;wolframius;andreati;Susanna;Matteo;Manuel7d9;susanna_schiavi;elisa_df;RitaDM;Letizia	Giulio Chiesa;Giacomo Zambianchi;Valerio Vitelli;Andrea Turcato;Susanna Zucca;Matteo Meroso;Manuel Lupotto;Susanna Schiavi;Elisa Del Fabbro;Rita De Molfetta;Letizia Diamante	lor18;galdan	Lorenzo Pasotti;Daniela Galli	BBa_K173000	BBa_K173999

The sequestering of glucose for fibre production by L. plantarum provides the additional benefit of effectively reducing dietary sugars. We have successfully extracted the four genes that code for cellulose synthase from the Acetobacter xylinum. These genes were then placed under the control of a strong constitutive promoter, and transformed into Lactobacillus plantarum. Plasmid and genome based expression of the synthase genes are being evaluated and characterized. In the future, cellulose production assays, evaluation of biofilm formation, and in vivo testing will be performed to determine viability as potential health benefits.	mkaern	Mads Kaern	None	None	None	None	None	None	ttye065;djedrysiak;Candyce;jjulus;olly_o;spilon;mlynn55;morto077;jmayo051;rzinoviev;bbuildman;ceule085@uottawa.ca;Justoutofhighschool;megascruffyIII;Justoutofhighschool2	Tammy Tye;Daniel Jedrysiak;Candyce Sun;Julienne Lumingu;Olga Vorobyova;Sophie Pilon;Michael Lynn;Matthew Orton;Jonathan Mayo;Radi Zinoviev;Buildman Bitja Biyong;Chris Euler;Samantha Graitson;Alex Power;Victor Malkov	None	None	BBa_K234000	BBa_K234999

Microbes such as Escherichia coli and Cuprivadis metallidurans have an endogenous multicomponent mercury (Hg2+) uptake and reduction operon, under the control of a metal responsive transcription factor, MerR.  By utilising elements of this pathway, with a novel recovery mechanism, mercury can be accumulated intracellularly and efficiently removed from the environment. The presence of mercury activates MerR, driving the expression of Antigen 43 (Ag43), a self-adhering surface protein. Coupling a mercury sensitive promoter to the expression of Ag43 enables cells to accumulate mercury then aggregate in solution. P. syringae is a ubiquitous airborne bacterium which expresses a unique protein, InaZ. This protein acts as a scaffold for ice nucleation, inducing precipitation. Optimal growth of P. syringae occurs at 22oC. By introducing five heat-shock genes, the tolerance range will be increased to better suit the Australian climate.  This modification has the potential to increase the availability of Australia’s most precious resource; water.

In our case, secretion of p53 or bax proteins to mitochondria leads to apoptosis without cell cycle arrest thus enabling complementation of traditional chemotherapeutical agents, which affect only proliferating cells.	iGEMUW	Jacek Bielecki	None	None	Smaegol;keton;PiotrStepien;pie;Jacek Bielecki	Pawel Krawczyk;Michael Lower;Piotr St;jbielecki	None	None	ffijalkowski;Melithaea;MarekK;Seth;Messer;Atrax;Grubs;Kami;Jarax;aw Pankowski;Justyna M.

However, the ability to utilize such proteins hinges upon their capacity to be isolated from their expression systems.  Our project aims to create an all-in-one protein expression and purification system using BioBrick standards to greatly simplify protein production for synthetic biologists, reducing the time and cost involved in standard protein purification methods.  Our method uses a novel combination of two systems: secretion and display.  By fusing two tags to the protein it can be secreted into the expression media, and subsequently directed to bind to the outside of the cell.  To collect the pure proteins, cells only need to be spun down and then resuspended in an elution buffer, releasing the protein of interest. Our research exhibits the utility of synthetic biology for developing new techniques that improve upon established practices.

We introduce a new concept called LegoRoboBrick.  The liquid handling system is build by designing and implementing 3 LegoRoboBrick modular components: ALPHA (Automated Lego Pipette Head Assembly), BETA (BioBrick Environmental Testing Apparatus), and PHI (Pneumatic Handling Interface).  We will demonstrate that the same BioBrick assembly software can run on multiple plug-and-play LegoRoboBrick instances with different physical dimensions and geometric configurations.

Phototrophs evolved large antennas to compete for photons in natural environments where light is scarce.  Consequently, cells at the surface of photobioreactors over-absorb light, leading to attenuated photobioreactor light penetration and starving cells on the interior of photons. This reduction of photosynthetic productivity has been identified as the primary impediment to improving photobioreactor efficiency.  While reduction of antenna size improves photosynthetic productivity, current approaches to this end uniformly truncate antennas and are difficult to manipulate from the perspective of bioengineering. We aim to create a modifiable system to optimize antenna size throughout the bioreactor by utilizing a synthetic regulatory mechanism that correlates expression of the pucB/A LH2 antenna genes with incident light intensity. This new application of synthetic biology serves to transform the science of antenna reduction into the engineering of antenna optimization.

We have designed a proof-of-concept for chromosome-building that will use the site-specific integrase of phage ?C31 to integrate a BioBrick into a defined locus of the E. coli genome. Six pairs of integrase-targeted att sites have been designed to be non-cross-reactive in order to support repeatable cassette-exchange reactions for chromosome building. We have also written software to model the integrase-mediated rearrangement of DNA molecules containing att sites, to aid the design of more elaborate chromosome-building systems. To selectively degrade the native chromosome we designed a nuclease-based, inducible genome-degradation system. In its simplest form, our system can be used to integrate biological devices into a chromosome in situations requiring stable copy number and selection-free maintenance.	ingalls	Brian Ingalls	None	None	maucoin	Marc Aucoin	None	None	danash;KirstenHoedlmoser;apmasell;MattGingerich;aspatri;ericalee10;Leah_Kocsis;eltiberi;Somil;hdyeung;Gunn;jlapointe;jheil;edoules;hparikh;Sparkle;mgjdelgr;p2mackin;NGE;naidarus;timlin737;dookehster;a2mclach	Danielle Nash;Kirsten Hoedlmoser;Andre Masella;Matthew Gingerich;Abhishek Patri;Chinhyun (Erica) Lee;Leah Kocsis;Erica Tiberia;Somil Bhargava;Hillary Yeung;Peter Gunn;Jordan Lapointe;John Heil;Eddie Yee Tak Ma;Harsh Parikh;Shira Davis;Marc Del Grande;Patrick MacKinnon;Wylee Co;Nasra Aidarus;Tim Lin;Brandon Wang;Alexander McLachlan	tcharles	Trevor Charles	BBa_K241000	BBa_K241999

Total crude oil replacement based on a 20% fuel titer and current fuel demands would require 5.6 trillion gallons of fresh water per year. Current fresh water supplies may not support this added demand. Alternatively, a sustainable approach may use a portion of the Earth’s 3.5x1020 gallons of ocean water. However, current fuel-producing organisms are unable to thrive in ocean-level osmolarities. Glycine betaine, a powerful osmoprotectant, shields organisms from salt-induced stress.  Wild-type Escherichia coli can acquire glycine betaine from their surroundings or synthesize it from environmental choline.  Two enzymes, glycine/sarcosine methyltransferase, and sarcosine/dimethyglycine methyltransferase, catalyze three successive methylations of glycine for de novo synthesis of glycine betaine.  Here, we demonstrate an engineered E. coli with an increased growth rate under salt induced stress.  We highlight utility by demonstrating the improved growth of fuel producing bacteria in ocean water.	pfleger	Brian Pfleger	None	None	dougweibel	Doug Weibel	None	None	Sandock;neverdreamed;TingZhang;RMS177;vkamat;ncira;n8pants;cwschultz88	Sarah R.

We were inspired by iGEM projects that utilize colored or fluorescent reporter molecules. Specifically, we thought “wouldn’t it be nice to be able to leave a plate out in the field, collect it a day or two later, and be able to tell at what time the synthesis of the reporter molecules was triggered?” Ideally, protein reporters would leave the cell and diffuse through the agar, leaving a clear history of their expression. To this end, we are 1) creating a library of Sec and Tat leader sequence biobricks for directing expressed proteins to the periplasm, 2) making an E. coli expression strain with a weakened outer cell wall that leaks most of the periplasmic proteins to the environment, and 3) measuring and modeling the diffusion of small molecules and proteins in agar to ascertain the ability to derive the times and conditions under which they originated.	mikemach	Michael Machczynski	None	None	asherie	Neer Asherie	None	None	jmeir;Rafihuntley;Paige	Juliet Meir;Raphael Huntley;Faige Seligman	None	None	BBa_K219000	BBa_K219999

As a consequence, not only fuels, but many other products including drugs, fine chemicals and plastic will have to be produced from renewable carbon sources. In parallel, we observe arable land per capita shrinking and more frequent droughts. But even by increasing agricultural productivity, plants will not be able to meet our massive demands. Therefore, we are developing an alternative route to sustainably produce complex carbon which significantly reduces the space and water needs.

Its primary cause is believed to be man-made CO2 emissions from transportation and electricity production. To tackle the issue of transportation emissions, we want to produce sustainable propane in Escherichia coli using cellulosic feedstock. The pathway is a patchwork of 10 different enzymes from different organisms, such as Mycobacterium marinum and Bacillus subtilis. We built a model of the pathway to identify its bottlenecks and concentrate our engineering efforts on them. To elevate our propane from a food crop -based  first generation biofuel to the second generation, we are integrating a secretion system for cellulose hydrolysing enzymes. To innovatively enhance our production system, we are bringing the two final enzymes of our pathway into close proximity by fusing them with micelle-forming amphiphilic proteins. This increases theoretical yield, bringing us one step closer to commercially viable biopropane.	mlinder	Markus Linder	None	None	hviskari	Heli Viskari	None	None	hyrkkal1;miinalt1;akorppoo;lehista1;riikkah;jrusanen;ptuomiranta;taalam;victorhcr;vastavm1	Linda Hyrkkänen;Tuukka Miinalainen;Annakarin Korppoo;Arto Lehisto;Riikka Huusari;Juuso Rusanen;Petra Tuomiranta;Tamannae Alam;Victor Hugo Corrêa Rodrigues;Milla-Mari Vastavuo	None	None	BBa_K1655000	BBa_K1655999

Many methods have been used in L-tert-leucine synthesis, but products are usually racemic. Scientists developed enzymatic reductive amination to product L-tert-leucine by using leucine dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase.     Initially, they used isolated enzymes, which can be disadvantageous for that enzymes are always destabilized in the isolation and purification process. What's more, the cofactor-NADH is rather an expensive raw material, which will enhance the cost. So scientists introduced whole-cell bio-catalysts to L-tert-leucine production. Whole-cell biocatalysts could stabilize enzymes and reduce the addition level of co-factor NADH.      However, the NADH consumption rate does not equal to its regeneration. The criminal is different strength of enzymes, we regulate the efficiency of RBS to control its strength. With mathematical modeling, we will get the most suitable efficiency of RBS of leucine dehydrogenase to decrease additional NADH.

This commonly allows the organism with the broken genetic device to dominate the population, undermining the purpose of the original reprogramming. Our goal is to characterize sequences within genes and plasmids that are more likely to mutate, since our research suggests that certain devices are more easily broken than others. We expanded on this research by transforming four E. coli strains with fluorescent protein plasmids. Breaking times varied noticeably between strains, suggesting that the host’s own genetic material also influenced device stability. Based on our findings, we decided to increase the stability of a few genetic devices, including the pDCAF3 plasmid, which the 2012 UT Austin iGEM team designed to allow E. coli to measure caffeine content through caffeine metabolism.	jbarrick	Jeffrey Barrick	None	None	Zen_Blade	Dennis Mishler	None	None	algutz;Natalie4;ReddyS;danielgarza95;rpoondla;mandu;trocha;devin_wehle;SamitaC94;SofiaC;kvasudevan;tylercamp;Nishtha01;Yanettheredia	Alejandro Gutierrez;Natalie Schulte;Sanjana Reddy;Daniel Garza;Revanth Poondla;Divija Mandalapu;Tyler Rocha;Devin Wehle;samita charolia;Sofia Chinea;Krithika Vasudevan;Tyler Camp;Nishtha Sharma;Yanett Heredia	None	None	BBa_K1627000	BBa_K1627999

One of the fundamental problems preventing the development of effective therapy is the difficulty to target cancer cells exclusively. In Boomerang, we're engineering a genetic device based on a simple concept of AND logic gate: the activation of our CRISPR/Cas9-based system is dependent on the existence of two cancer-specific promoters that control the expression of Cas9 and gRNA, and the combination of these two will occur only in cancer cells. CRISPR/Cas9 system allows several applications of Boomerang: 1) disruption of genes essential for cancer survival; and 2) activation of suicide genes, or color proteins for cancer cell detection (e.g., for complete surgical removal). Our system can be potentially designed according to unique characteristics of a patient's tumor, paving the way to personalized medicine.

We created two technical approaches built upon self-made E.coli cell extract and our newly established Plasmid Repressor Interaction Assay (PRIA). Both can be immobilized on paper. The fluorescence signal is detected via smartphone.     With these novel biosensor designs we tackle the problem of date rape drug intoxications, which is of increasing relevance in our area, by detecting a common ingredient. Another major problem is the contamination of water with heavy metals. Heavy metal sensors designed by previous iGEM teams as well as new biosensors are combined to a modular cell-free test strip for simultaneous detection. All in all, we are providing an extensible biosensor on paper as a valuable tool for water quality analysis for everyone.	joernk	Joern Kalinowski	None	None	Kristian	Kristian Müller	None	None	mrfreeze;tobiasV;MartaJ;Luzia;MelissaK;linhho;Gila;ubartecz;andreyer;JaninaL	Alexander Gräwe;Tobias Vornholt;Marta Eva Jackowski;Luzia Buchholz;Melissa Kracht;Uyen Linh Ho;Gila Drews;Ursela Barteczko;Anna Dreyer;Janina Lüders	Tore;manuelw;MatzeR;LukasR	Tore Bleckwehl;Manuel Wittchen;Matthias Ruwe;Lukas Rositzka	BBa_K1758000	BBa_K1758999

So BIT-CHINA designed an intelligent pH-Controller inside the cell. Our pH-Controller contains two sub-systems. One is resistance system, and the other is fine-regulation system. Resistance system can make bacteria survive in an expanded range of pH. Fine-regulation system is used to adjust the environmental pH by synthesis of acid or alkali. Several kinds of recombinase were applied in this sub-system to achieve various regulation effectiveness. The two sub-systems working together allows for lowered artificial pH regulation costs in industrial fermentation, meanwhile the two systems also can regulate the pH of soil, because the hosts with our pH-Controller will maintain high efficiency when the environmental pH is not optimal and they can adjust the environmental pH as we expect. Combined with the projects we did before, our project can achieve more functions.	bitlichun	Chun Li	None	None	None	None	None	None	LiJinlinT.K.;biotar;chance;oOHamsterOo;Mingming;luohui;Philosophia;SHOYOSWIND;chongchong;Rambo;Master;JIAQIXU;hlyBIT;XinZhou;KarlTang;yangjing;Queenie	Jinlin Li;Chenyi Li;Changxin Zhang;Zeyan Li;Mingming Cao;Hui Luo;Jiadong Zhong;Xiao Peng;Wenxin Bai;Zongzhi Lv;Pengcheng Zhang;JIAQI XU;Lingyun Huang;Xin Zhou;TANG JIAQI;Jing Yang;Qu Yangyi	coffee528;houhuilongfei;Genlin;silla;EricLiu;sophia1;zhu326ming;keer	Ke Xu;Hui Hou;Genlin Zhang;Yinghua Xu;Xiaochen Liu;Xiaoyan Wang;Ming Zhu;Caixia Wang	BBa_K1675000	BBa_K1675999

However, these pesticides can pollute the environment and increase the pest resistance substantially. Such that, environment-friendly biological pest control methods are needed badly.  Our project, which concerns mainly on the crucially pathogenic organism nematode first, intends to build a kind of novel engineering bacteria which contain a switch promoter that controlled by the light intensity. It means that our bacteria will express organics to allure pests at night, and synthesis specific toxin to kill the pests after they devour them during the day. Furthermore, the bacteria will initiate suicide to avoid the damage to environment.  After a sophisticated nematode trap system is built, we will continue and expand our systems for other kinds of agricultural pests, aiming at building the bait and the toxin database of various pests.

A promising solution is to reliably control proteins that naturally execute genetic modifications. Current strategies to regulate activity of such proteins primarily rely on modulating protein expression level through transcriptional control; however, these methods are susceptible to slow response and leaky expression. In contrast, strategies that exploit post-translational regulation of activity, such as conditional dimerization of split protein halves, have been demonstrated to bypass these limitations. Here, we compare the relative efficiency of previously characterized dimerization domains in regulating activities of three important genetic manipulation proteins - integrases and recombination directionality factors for genetic logic applications, and saCas9 for in vivo genome editing applications. We also establish guidelines to rationally identify promising protein split sites. Our characterization of these systems in mammalian cells ultimately paves way for important biomedical applications.	wilwong	Wilson Wong	None	None	mokhalil	Ahmad (Mo) Khalil	None	None	nsalv;jviola;shaheer;Abha;jeffc;ryankate	Nicholas Salvador;John Viola;Shaheer Piracha;Abha Patil;Jeffrey Chen;Kathleen Ryan	disrani;bhwein	Divya Israni;Benjamin Weinberg	BBa_K1733000	BBa_K1733999

Current recycling techniques demand high energy consumption, and are completely overwhelmed by the annual amount of rubber waste. In addition, natural rubber degradation may take up to 1000 years. Here we aim to accelerate natural rubber degradation by genetically engineering Escherichia coli expressing two enzymes: RoxA (Rubber oxygenase) and Lcp (Latex clearing protein). For degradation of vulcanized rubber, the project includes a pre-treatment using Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, a bacterium that naturally devulcanizes rubber. Both of these processes will be scaled up in bioreactors. The major resulting compound of the designed process is ODTD (12-oxo-4,8-dimethyl-trideca-4,8-diene-1-al), a triisoprene unit that we are working to transform in fuel, a product of high commercial interest. Consequently, besides enabling faster rubber degradation and decreasing final pollutant emission, our project also grants the final product a considerable economic interest.	anapaula	Ana Paula Ulian Araujo	None	None	richard@ifsc.usp.br	richard charles garratt	None	None	Rabesquine;laisribovski;laiscbrazaca;paulalins;mariana_garcia;Kuririn;KarenFC;Analima;LeticiaCTavares;IvanRSilva;deborahcmendonca;evertonsilva;grazivasconcelosb;camilaboralli;CamilaBramorski;criscasonatomelo;thmosqueiro;JennySoares;fabifantinelli;Danilo	Victor Henrique Rabesquine Nogueira;Laís Ribovski;Laís Canniatti Brazaca;Paula Maria Pincela Lins;Mariana Lopes Garcia;Bruno Ono;Karen Freire Carvalho;Ana Laura de Lima;Leticia Camargo Tavares;Ivan Rosa e Silva;Deborah Cezar Mendonça;Everton Silva;Graziele Vasconcelos;Camila Maria S.

Experts estimate that honeybees pollinate $14 billion worth of crops per year in United States. Though the mechanisms which CCD occur are many fold and remain uncertain, neonicotinoid pesticides have been implicated. Gilliamella apicola is a bacterium that natively resides in the bee midgut. Our project aims to engineer Gilliamella to metabolize imidacloprid, a common neonicotinoid, into harmless organic compounds using three cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP6CM1vQ, CYP6G1, and HUMCYPDB1. Though 6-CNA, the breakdown product of imidacloprid, displays significantly lower toxicity, it still induces sublethal effects. As such, we have also incorporated a pre-existing 6-CNA degradation pathway from Pseudomonas putida for complete breakdown of imidacloprid. We believe honeybees that harbour this engineered bacterium in probiotic form will become less susceptible to common field doses of imidacloprid; thus, significantly reducing the risk of CCD.

This leads to an excess of short chain cellulose fibers in the factory’s water system. Microbes feed off the starches and produce odorous butyric acid. The current solution is to use biocides, but this is expensive, short term, and environmentally unsafe. Our solution is to engineer a S.cerevisiae cell to produce the alpha amylase enzyme from B.amyloliquefaciens. The alpha amylase breaks down the starch molecules in the water, removing the food source of the butyric acid producing microbes. The genetically modified yeast were tested in both soluble starch concentrations and industrial water samples. The amount of starch dropped from .006% to 0% within two hours. The amylase enzyme is able to degrade starch effectively in industrial water samples, making it a viable, sustainable, and environmentally safe treatment of industrial wastewater.

However,the weeds have somehow developed to be resistant to the herbicide because of the more and more extensive use of the herbicide. Therefore, people have to raise the amount of herbicide used in agricultural industry year by year, but the increased amount of herbicide have caused a lot of harmful effect such as toxic substance remaining, crop growth being inhibited and so on. In order to solve the problem, a novel use of herbicide has been figured out—— the mix of herbicide. The mix use of the herbicide has plenty of benefits including decreasing the dose, increasing the efficacy, decreasing the poison residual and expanding the weed control spectrum. In order to adapting the novel use of herbicide, our team created four new genes, all of which have the resistance to two different herbicide.

One of the biggest problems is the robustness of the system. Great progress has been made with industrial production techniques, but contaminations are still a considerable problem the industry faces. Insufficient control of contaminations in bioreactors could compromise entire batches, resulting in high expenses. Team Chalmers Gothenburg will solve the contamination problem once and for all using a novel strategy to detect and combat contaminations in yeast based bioreactors. The solution involves two genetic systems, one signaling and contamination detection system and one repair system for survival after contamination termination. These two systems are made from innovative uses of ESDSA repair, CRISPR technology and MAPK cascades. The two systems also set the foundation for a whole range of new applications, from DNA assembly to laboratory markers.

The symptoms include bloating, stomach cramps, diarrhea and nausea. In this project, we propose to use a synthetic biology approach to achieve 2 major aims: (1) design and construct an Escherichia coli probiotic strain (Lac Breaker) to tackle the lactose intolerance problem which involves high expression of the beta-galactosidase enzyme (driven by expression vector A) and its release from the E. coli cell by autolysis (using a lysis gene cassette on vector B); and (2) evaluate different “lysis gene cassette” constructs as an effective means to extract high value-added recombinant proteins in biotechnology. This is an improvement of the iGEM project of the 2008 Caltech team (Curing Lactose Intolerance) with greater emphasis on the design, construction and evaluation of various “lysis gene cassettes”.

All this under the approach of synthetic biology, not using plastic silicone or other contaminants.  In Chile in the last 5 years there have been 20-25 cases of skin cancer per 100 inhabitants. One of the main factors is Ultraviolet (UV) radiation which causes severe cell damage when a certain amount is exceeded.   Our team proposes a system that alerts the intensity of UV radiation. The project is represented by a wristband that is composed by genetically modified bacteria that detects ultraviolet light and according to intensity/danger, a coloration is generated.

The shared characteristic these consortia is the specialization of individual populations of microbes within the community. Given the specialization and regulatory controls available, a greater range of tasks and durability is made available. After all, cooperation and division of labor is the driving force behind emergent properties. Here, we present a method to engineer a synthetic consortia of probiotics, namely, Escherichia coli ""Nissle"" and Lactobacillus reuteri, to express PYY, Ghrelin, and GLP1 - gut hormones involved in regulating appetite and insulin production. Such an undertaking involves establishing a secretion system via signal peptides and an intra- and inter- species communication mechanism via AHL-based quorum sensing.

Due to human error, oil leakage is bound to occur, and because agriculture and the oilfield are closely intertwined, contamination is a cause for concern. ECOS, alginate beads containing modified E. coli, detects crude oil in a sample of soil or water. Detection of oil spills is a major issue because if oil contamination goes unchecked, the carcinogens found in oil can damage the crops and health of animals in the area. The current system for oil detection takes weeks before a sample is tested and returned. By this point, the result  is invalid. ECOS allows detection of contamination on site and is easy to use.

We've developed a customisable, linearised, double stranded plasmid with two sticky overhangs. When the sticky overhangs come into contact with a target sequence, the binding of the DNA sequence to the overhangs circularises the plasmid. The circularised plasmid is then transformed into competent E. coli cells. Bacterial growth of green fluorescent colonies indicates a positive result, confirming presence of complementary DNA target sequence. This system could act as a cheap alternative to digital and real time PCR, as target DNA fragments are amplified in living cells without use of a costly PCR machine. This system could potentially be used as a diagnostic or screening tool for viral and/or bacterial infection such as Human Papilloma Virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Our Escherichia coli has been genetically engineered to produce terpenoids. The strain digests spent frying oil, a carbon source with high-energy molecules that can be broken down via beta oxidation. The rate limiting step of beta-oxidation is Acyl-CoA synthetase (FadD). Increased transcription of FadD will allow our strain to better utilize frying oil waste. Terpenoid production will then be achieved via the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway which is endogenous to E. coli. By increasing flux through the MEP pathway we will increase product yields. Safety considerations have been incorporated into the project through design of cellular level biocontainment. A kill switch, KillerRed, has been improved from previous years. When KillerRed protein is produced the cell turns red. Upon interaction with green light, the cell produces reactive oxygen species which damage the cell, resulting in cell death.	cpeebles79	Christie A. M.

In Colorado, ground water contamination from fracking has endangered many communities’ safe drinking water.  To address this environmental health issue, we developed a biosensor to detect naphthalene, a common reagent in fracking.  Naphthalene detection and output signal amplification can be achieved using the Lux promoter and the Bxb1 integrase. Our biosensor uses a naphthalene induced promoter located upstream of the BxB1 integrase.  Once expressed, Bxb1 acts on a logic gate to express RFP. A Lux cell-cell signaling system from V. fischeri will enable our system to be more sensitive at low concentrations.

For this reason, synthetic biologists have tried to engineer these proteins and to switch modules to create analogs and novel natural products, but with little success. Despite being modular, the interactions between modules have evolved to be highly specific, making synthetic  Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthases (NRPS) a challenge to engineer. Instead of switching modules we introduced a recombination system targeting oligo integration in Bacillus subtilis.

Detecting antibiotic resistance quickly is crucial to determine the correct treatment for different patients and for setting up quarantines to prevent spreading. We hypothesized that is possible to use quorum sensing (QS) to devise a rapid way for cells to report the existence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Here, we developed a reporter cell that expresses GFP in the presence of the QS signaling molecule acyl homoserine lactone (AHL). Our test cells (which act as a simulation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria) express lactonase, which breaks down AHL. In our experimental system, test cells should signify their presence by breaking down AHL and preventing GFP expression in reporter cells. Therefore, our project serves as a proof of principle and we hope that our work will serve as a basis for developing similar, more sophisticated quorum sensing-based detection systems in the future.	elanvitalsouthkorea	You-Jin Hwang	None	None	jeffhannah81	Jeffrey Hannah	None	None	youngchan;crystalsoojung;sooji;Nurichoi;brittanylee;Meen;sophielee;hyunmin;jihoon	young chan kim;Soo Jung LEE;SOOJI  LEE;Nu Ri Choi;Brittany LEE;Seung Meen Choi;Songeun Lee;Hyun Min Park;Ji Hoon Kang	None	None	BBa_K1584000	BBa_K1584999

Currently, genetic circuits reproducing digital logic are limited in scalability and robustness by output discrepancies and crosstalk between transcriptional pathways. We propose to address these issues using RNA-guided dCas9 fused to a transcription activation domain as a programmable transcription factor. Fusion dCas9 targeted upstream of the transcription starting site (TSS) recruits RNA polymerase. Yet, dCas9 may also sterically hinder transcription initiation if bound too close to the TSS. The guide RNA acts as a “biological wire”: it determines dCas9’s binding site and enables specific regulation of homogenous synthetic promoters. Exploiting these properties we aim to build biocompatible transistor-like elements whose assembly may allow for the creation of chainable and parallelizable bio-logic gates. Ultimately, we hope to create a toolkit facilitating the design and implementation of bio-logic circuits thereby enabling more complex decision-making in cells.	groovescience	Bart Deplancke	None	None	maerkl;Grisoni;Frochaux	Sebastian Maerkl;Barbara Grisoni;Michael frochaux	None	None	rmeli;vicsteininger;bopekno;ninavt;Paola_M;Awowen;Vinc;E.Cuillery;JosephH;lsteiner;gregthouvenin;123	Rocco Meli;Victor Steininger;Cyril Pulver;Nina van Tiel;Paola Malsot;Uran Axel;Vincent Jacquot;Emilie Cuillery;Joseph Heng;Loïc Steiner;Gregoire Thouvenin;Ari Sarfatis	romanepfl;n.huwiler;sakura.nussbaum;daino3z	Romane Breysse;Nikolaus Huwiler;Sakura Nussbaum;Riccardo Dainese	BBa_K1723000	BBa_K1723999

Upon binding, MicroBeacons detect the increased lactate production of the CTCs via a lactate sensor and trigger quorum sensing between each other, which results in expression of fluorescent protein. Overall, the MicroBeacons selectively generate stronger fluorescence on the surface of sTRAIL-sensitive and lactate-secreting tumor cells compared to healthy cells. We anticipate our device to be a reliable, fast, and cheap method for the detection of metastasis for a wide range of cancers.	sven	Sven Panke	None	None	joergs;kobibenenson;savastay	Joerg Stelling;Yaakov Benenson;SAVAS TAY	None	None	hmustafa;Milhene;balisa;charlotteRamon;anmichel;iGEMike	Harun Mustafa;Anna Fomitcheva Khartchenko;Lisa Baumgartner;Charlotte Ramon;Anja Michel;Michael Meier	sabine.oesterle;luwidmer;d.gerngross;jordich;margauxdastor;janalin	Sabine Oesterle;Lukas Widmer;Daniel Gerngross;Christian Jordi;margaux dastor;Janina Linnik	BBa_K1847000	BBa_K1847999

Binding causes conformational changes, revealing an RBS and allowing the expression of a reporter. We aim to design a toehold collection with varying reporters including chromoproteins, fluorescent proteins and bioluminescent luciferase. Our project therefore set out to create a diagnostic test to detect a given RNA sequence in a safe, low-tech and cost-effective manner. The trigger-recognition region of the toehold can be altered to bind different specific RNA targets, changing the application. Our project is tailored towards detection of RNA from Mycobacterium Bovis. A problem prevalent in the southwest UK, it is the cause of bovine TB with current testing unable to distinguish between Mycobacterium strains. Expression of our toeholds will utilise S30 cell-free kits and reporter data will be collected using FACS/TECAN. This data will be used for simulation and model fitting.

Typical ELISA-based assays are time-consuming and expensive. We propose an advanced procedure for the simultaneous detection of various diseases in a fast and inexpensive manner, the DiaCHIP.  Our approach is based on the interaction of antibodies with their respective antigens. Different antigens are immobilized on a protein array generated by cell-free protein expression, using the corresponding DNA array as a template. Placed in a microfluidic chamber, the protein array is incubated with a patient’s blood sample. The interaction between an antibody in the sample and the corresponding immobilized antigen results in a local change of the optical thickness of the surface. This change can be detected using a label-free and real-time measurement technology called iRIf (imaging Reflectometric Interference). Offering simultaneous screening for several diseases, our DiaCHIP has strong potential to improve future diagnostics.	mulbrich	Maximilian Ulbrich	None	None	NGensch;Guenterroth	Nicole Gensch;Günter Roth	None	None	JulikaN;LuiKei;RamonaE;JuliaD;AralS;dk;anneseifert92;MaurizioC;NathalieW;JulianB;SimonN;RabeaJ;SaFi;Julia_Z;BenjaminWerle;katharinamoos91;SabineB;rrqptow;Jeha	Julika Neumann;Luisa Keilholz;Ramona Emig;Julia Donauer;Lara Stühn;Daniel Kokotek;Anne Seifert;Maurizio Camagna;Nathalie Woessner;Julian Bender;Simon Nicklaus;Rabea Jesser;Sabrina Fischer;Julia Zbiegly;Benjamin Werle;Katharina Moos;Sabine Bognar;Ricardo Oude Weernink;Julian Eble	MaikeS;stefan.kraemer;PhilippS;Ilona;PatrickG;pm1009;Christin;Normann;TobHer;jburger	Maike Smits;Stefan Krämer;Philipp Schwenk;Ilona Blank;Patrick Gonschorek;Philipp Andreas Meyer;Christin Rath;Normann Kilb;Tobias Herz;Juergen Burger	BBa_K1621000	BBa_K1621999

It is home to many endemic species, as well as the main economic drive of the southern area. Due to its historical background, it is considered World Heritage by UNESCO since 1987.  Currently, it presents several pollution issues such as an excessive amount of  nitrites and nitrates, which in turn causes an overpopulation of Nymphaea, and thus anoxic conditions. As a consequence, flora and fauna endemic to the lake are dying. Our biosystem will activate a denitrification pathway taken from Pseudomonas stutzeri whenever O2 levels in the water  are sensed as critical, using an O2 promoter. This enhances water conditions by reducing NO2 and NO3 into N2, and therefore algae and water lilies. Successfully implementing our biosystem will lead to a better future for the biodiversity in Xochimilco.

Many industrial and biological processes require a range of different enzymes. Our aim is to provide a powerful tool to combine these enzymatic processes.

Our construct takes multiple dockerins from a variety of bacteria and connects exchangeable enzymes to a scaffoldin base through automatic assembly. The combination of the catalytic forces of enzymes, derived from different sources, onto one common molecular base creates a synergistic effect. This drives a cascade in which the product of one reaction acts as the substrate for the consecutive one. In the future the Flexosome could, for instance, be used to combine enzymes in washing detergents or even link enzymatic cascades for the production of biofuels. It can therefore be applied from industrial over pharmaceutical to environmental setups.	rdaniel	Rolf Daniel	None	None	HeikoLiesegang	Heiko Liesegang	None	None	JSchwanbeck;verena.siebert;Avril.Hoyningen;sindhuthiagarajan;ashaikhqasem;NidaAmin;Alex_L;Stefani;udhayanarayanan;Debby;Twesi	Julian Schwanbeck;Verena Siebert;Avril von Hoyningen-Huene;Sindhu Thiagarajan;Alaa Shaikhqasem;Nida Amin;Alexander Lohmeyer;Stefani Diaz Valerio;Udhaya Bhaskar Sathya Narayanan;Deborah Horne;Dennis Twesmann	None	None	BBa_K1865000	BBa_K1865999

To reach the end user with our work, we create straightforward tests for the detection of numerous noxious substances.	reils	Roland Eils	None	None	bdv;ilehmann	Barbara Di Ventura;Irina Lehmann	None	None	sholderbach;dheid;hboog;Hammer;CLingLi;Frieda;Treis;hübner;Jasmin;MAJendrusch;Max_Seidel	Stefan Holderbach;Daniel Heid;Hendrik Boog;Alexander Hammer;Christine Ling Li Trautmann;Frieda Anna Sorgenfrei;Tim Treis;Klaus Lukas Hübner;Jasmin Dehnen;Michael Adrian Jendrusch;Maximilian Seidel	philipp.walch;KatharinaH;iliakats;stefan.kallenberger;LukasB	Philipp Darius Konstantin Walch;Katharina Höfer;Ilia Kats;Stefan Kallenberger;Lukas Brenner	BBa_K1614000	BBa_K1614999

Currently, farmers monitor soil macronutrient levels with chemical assays.  We hypothesize that PNK biosensors based on genetic circuits refined through millions of years of evolution will measure the nutrients available to a growing plant more accurately.      We are building on the work of previous iGEM teams on soil biosensors and characterizing new parts. We have developed and tested new nitrate-, phosphate-, and potassium-responsive promoters to produce a colorimetric output in a low input environment and added these parts to the registry.  We are working on deploying our NPK biosensor in a colorimetric cell-free system and in biofertilizer strains of bacteria.    It is our hope that this NPK biosensor technology can be used to optimize the farming and fertilizing process.	kinglchow	King L.

Hence, a tightly regulated switch is needed to induce suicide by the leaked organisms, ultimately leading to destruction of undesired genetic material. In our project we design and engineer two biological circuits based on the versatile CRISPR Cas systems as replaceable killing switches. To minimize basal expression, arabinose and tryptophan help repress the expression of Cas associated proteins, gRNA and crRNA. In order to achieve biosafety, destruction of essential genes will be activated when the synthetic organisms leave their specified working environment. We sought to investigate the regulation of the circuits and compare the killing efficiency of the two Cas systems using E. Coli BL21 DE3 as the chassis.	juliantanner	Julian A.

To echo such demand, we developed Euk.cement: a live eukaryotic cell based auto-cementation kit. By surface displayed silica binding peptides and secreted flocculating proteins, Euk.cement will target onto any silica containing particles, such as sands and rocks, and stick them together. This system will be automatically initiated only in dark with a light operated switch. While carbon dioxide released from the metabolism of cells will finally complete the calcium carbonate sedimentation. This economical and ecological friendly innovation can be utilized for a wide range of industrial or environmental applications, such as construction and restoration of building foundations, bridge piers, or even artificial reefs for aquaculture. Since we have exploited a new kind of marine yeast as chassis, the application field of eukaryotic synthetic biology has then been considerably broadened.	zhanyee	Yi Zhan	None	None	HUST_Yanyunjun;Sissi;HUST_XueYu;albertning;xieqian	Yunjun Yan;Qian Ge;Yu Xue;Kang Ning;Qian Xie	None	None	ShuyanTang;BlueCherry;WangjieLiu;xjj;Shareycheng;Hoooope;Lei_Yin;wuguozhao;Kirro;Tengu;yuzhuxuyang;LiuJiatong;ZhiZeng;YanXiaoZheng;Yangzixi;xiangshuaiying	Shuyan Tang;Qi Zhao;Wangjie Liu;Junjie Xu;Zhangyu Cheng;Wang Xi;Lei Yin;Guozhao Wu;Ruihao Li;Tianguang Wang;Yang Xu;Jiatong Liu;Zhi Zeng;YanXiao Zheng;Zixi Yang;shuaiying xiang	None	None	BBa_K1592000	BBa_K1592999

In this project, we are working on creating a new kind of life form, mixed-reality cells (MR. Cell), which are half-real and half-virtual. To demonstrate our idea, a genetic oscillator was built in E. coli as the real part and an e-oscillator was simulated in a computer as the virtual part. The two parts could interact with each other through an interface device composed of microfluidic chip and chemical/optical modulator. At the beginning, the two oscillators work independently in a dual-reality state. With their interaction, they would gradually adjust to each other without human interference to a strongly coupled and synchronized mixed-reality state. A prototype of MR. Cell was demonstrated in this project which has great potential in a wide range of the future biological research.

Food spoilage renders a product undesirable for consumption and is the outcome of the biochemical activity of a microbial community.    It is known that bacteria often communicate with each other through quorum sensing, where the communication is through certain signal molecules (auto-inducers) that freely diffuse into the environment.The enzymatic activities that account for quality degradation of food products are regulated by quorum sensing activity. Our engineered organism can be used as a marker of freshness in different kinds of food (dairy and other packaged products) by detecting the presence of Acyl Homoserine Lactones using the Lux operon system in E. coli and rendering a visible colour change (through lycopene production), thus preventing the consumption of such food and aiding healthy living.	agneyo	Agneyo Ganguly	None	None	None	None	None	None	bharath77021;vivekrai;yogesh;jugalmohapatra;eklavya;harsheelsoin;Meth_chef;krishnadeepak;dusadv;rhushikesh.iitkgp;Roshan_kgp;khandelwalchetan3;Dipashasinha;sanjay_Prasad;satyamag28;shauryaveer95;pruthvi	GUGULOTHU SRIRAM BHARATH;Vivek Rai;Yogesh Lakhotia;Jugal Mohapatra;Adarsh Mukesh;Harsheel Singh Soin;Karan Gupta;Krishna Deepak;Varshit Dusad;Rhushikesh Phadke;Roshan Kumar Satapathy;Chetan Khandelwal;Dipasha Sinha;Sanjay Prasad;Satyam Agarwal;Shauryaveer Singh;Pruthvi Patel	mkmaiti	Mrinal Kumar Maiti	BBa_K1862000	BBa_K1862999

One example of naturally occurring surfactant is rhamnolipid. Rhamnolipid has a broad application, starting from enhanced oil recovery, oil spill and pollutant management, to industries such as food, cosmetic, and health care. But unfortunately this biosurfactant is produced by opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, ITB_Indonesia utilises optimised rhlAB gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa for rhamnolipid production, combined by LacI control and reporter protein for controllable and observable production in E. coli. This rhamnolipid-producing E. coli is named RhamCOLIpid. Produced rhamnolipid is further tested for one of its usages, Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). EOR using rhamnolipid is expected to serve as a green alternative to increase oil production in Indonesia.	131835246	Sony Suhandono	None	None	maelita;mapri;debbieretno;rukman	Maelita R.

Because there is no simple and convenient way to detect and degrade formaldehyde, we hope to design biobricks to solve this problem by using microorganism.     We find that there is a special promoter called hxlR in Bacillus subtilis, which can be induced by formaldehyde and express downstream genes.     First, we use special features of pET vectors to express two key enzymes, named formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and formaldehyde dehydrogenase (PADH). Then we add the gene of T7 RNA polymerase in the downstream of promoter hxlR in PSB1C3. Finally, when T7 polymerase is expressed, Vector pET-DUET can express PADH and FDH. In this way, the whole system can be induced by formaldehyde and express PADH and FDH to degrade it.	ygwu	Yongge Wu	None	None	ChaohuiGao;swguan;liuxb;liuchengbai;Xin;huiyang;lihaiyan	Chaohui Gao;Shuwen Guan;Liu Xiaobo;Chengbai Liu;Xin Hu;Yang Hui;Haiyan Li	None	None	KLM;Purkinlin;shusuqiao;531930993;xiaoxiaoa;sayhello;chanron;Bestir;adoramus;thinkerxiaomi;LinjingZhang;Alyssa;liuziyu;ClaraShi;whislin;Awesome;passer;undergraduatefang;WangMan;Nanala;victorsun;lenora0220;louxiaoyao;LingyuanMeng;Relly;marvelouscandy;jinzheyu1994	Jun Zhou;Zhexi Piao;Hui Shu;Yifan Zhang;Hongyan Mu;Kaikai Wang;Rongze Chen;Yongzhen Chen;Long Di;Huimin Li;Linjing Zhang;Yu Cao;Ziyu Liu;Linqing Shi;Wei Lin;Juntao Chen;Qingji Xu;Yifang Liu;Man Wang;Renxia Zhang;Wenyu Sun;He Huang;Xinyue Lou;Lingyuan Meng;Xuerui Zeng;Jingjuan Chen;Zheyu Jin	546225650;zzy240610627;OlivaLu;ljr19941117;Amberzhuo;liuanan;hihicao1;KevinLee	Licheng Wang;Zhaoyu Zhang;Xiaotong Lu;Junru Li;Zhuo Wan;Anan Liu;Cao Shang;Xiaoqi Li	BBa_K1706000	BBa_K1706999

Fluorescent proteins such as a Green Fluorescent Protein are widely used as optical sensor. We forcused on Dronpa in them. Dronpa is a green fluorescent protein which is cloning from Echinophyllia sp.This  is a photswitcable fluorescent protein, it can reversibly change On state and Off state. We used mutant of Dronpa, Dronpa145N. Dronpa 145N switches on under 400nm light and forms a tetramer, and switches off under 500nm light and forms monomer.  Fuse target protein with Dronpa 145N. Dronpa 145N domain reversibly change monomer and tetramer by light, the target protein between Dronpa 145N domain can change active conformation and inactive conformation. In this way, we can control protein activity by light. This method does not require co factor and use blue toxic light.

Our project aims to produce self-assembling conductive nano-wires using a functional amyloid system synthesised by E.coli. We use the export machinery of the endogenous curli amyloid system of E.coli, normally responsible for biofilm formation, to produce functional extracellular amyloid nano-fibrils composed of the amyloid-forming domain of the yeast prion protein Sup35. Our engineered BioBrick plasmid will contain the amyloid-forming domain of Sup35, Sup35NM, linked to the curli signal sequence for extracellular amyloid protein export, and also to cytochrome b562 to allow for electron transport. Once exported, the Sup35NM monomers will polymerise to form the amyloid fibrils decorated with cytochrome b562. Exogenous addition of haem will allow cytochrome b562 on Sup35NM fibrils to fold into its active conformation, allowing electron transport along the length of the amyloid fibres. Our project has the potential to provide a source of both renewable nano-material and energy.	wfx	Wei-Feng Xue	None	None	mwass;MarkShepherd;LucaMarcelli	Mark Wass;Mark Shepherd;Gianluca Marcelli	None	None	S.Thakali;NSloan;jamesaston;anna.beltrami;RCrane;act;RaneemJ;rjm44;KatarinaP;M.Chikomo;Jpope	Suparna Thakali;Natalie Sloan;James Aston;Anna Chiara Beltrami;Richard Crane;Alice Tomlinson;Raneem AlJaghoub;Robert Middlewick;Katarina Pisani;Moyra Chikomo;Jonathan pope	mclee;bb272	Mun Ching Lee;ben blakeman	BBa_K1739000	BBa_K1739999

We made a program named ‘Gil’ which helps you with finding and constructing bio-chemical pathways. Given only reactants and final products, you can get several possible pathways using our program. It has significant feature of biological scoring system that based on meaningful compounds in energy such as ATP, number of carbon, and NADP. This scoring system can guide you like navigation to find the most efficient pathway or to build a plausible de novo pathway. Our program also provides gene sequence information of the pathways so it will be more easy to synthesize your pathway.   Using this program, we designed a wetlab experiment, making an agar utilizing EFC. We found a pathway that starts from agarose to galactose, producing NADH during its process. This NADH is then oxidized by diaphorase and produces electricity.	igchoi	In Geol Choi	None	None	mbnmbn00;unjgs	Byoungnam Min;Kyoungwoo Jang	None	None	khJeong;JiwonKim;mingming1103;ghkdthsms;lsj090158;recyclable;kyujin412;hychoi220;mshanjy94;Polt;010wns;Sumin;SooHwan;kdh0120	Kyeong hun Jeong;Jiwon Kim;Min ki Choi;Jeongsu Hwang;Seongju Lee;Hyeong Woo Kim;Kyujin Jeong;Hye yeong Choi;JuYoung Han;eun san Ko;Junhee KIM;Sumin Cho;SooHwan Kim;Deok ho Kim	leouno	Jiseung Lee	BBa_K1754000	BBa_K1754999

We focused on using zeaxanthin to counter the toxic effects of increased free fatty acids in an altered Synechococcus elongatus 7942 strain. Zeaxanthin acts as an antioxidant, stabilizes the membrane, and is needed for electron transport chain function. To increase the concentration of zeaxanthin and its precursors, we introduced a circuit containing parts of the zeaxanthin synthesis pathway. The La Cañada subset of our team focused on tocopherol, a metabolite that has similar properties to zeaxanthin in cyanobacteria. Tocopherol acts as an antioxidant, protects the cell from lipid peroxidation, and enhances photosynthesis. A circuit was made with the gene p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase to catalyze the formation of homogenistic acid, the rate limiting step of tocopherol synthesis. In an attempt to further increase the production of fatty acids, both zeaxanthin and tocopherol circuits are dynamically regulated, utilizing a fatty acid-sensitive promoter-repressor system, pLR and FadR.	jtsui	Jennifer Tsui	None	None	daneshby	Yousef Daneshbod	None	None	NoemiRios;LauraSahawneh;ALL;SleepingSnorunt;markkaram;andrewokimura;Harold!;alinakhzanyan;david.vorobyov;catheyseoo;milesyun;rudramenon	"Noemi Rios;Laura Sahawneh;Alec Lourenco;Christos Menemenlis;Mark Karam;Andrew Okimura;Harry Bennett;Alina Khzanyan;David Vorobyov;Catherine Seo;Sung-Joon ""Miles"" Yun;Rudra Menon"	Amyojiang;Estefania.gomez;aalvarez;pcompeau;kzhang;llourenco	Amy jiang;Estefania Gomez;Alvaro Alvarez;Patricia Compeau;Kate Q.

Using E. coli  to colonise the gut, NAD+/NAD(H) levels could be increased by upregulating nadD, nadE and PncB enzymes in the E. coli cytosol; these gene products will be tagged and exported into the periplasm via the tat system to produce NAD+/NAD(H), which will be exported into the gut. The genes and killswitch will be inserted into E. coli, whilst the remaining aspects of the project will be theoretical due to ethical and safety restrictions. Speculatively, increased NAD+/NAD(H) could treat neurodegenerative disorders by mitigating the destruction of neurons and help with muscle fatigue. Regeneration of muscle fibres to restore strength and overall energy levels would be achieved by increased oxidative phosphorylation triggered by NAD+/NAD(H). This treatment provides low-cost NAD+/NAD(H) as part of an autonomous system; increasing the patients’ quality of life.	badgerichard	Richard Badge	None	None	raymond_dalgleish;aj139	Raymond Dalgleish;Andrew Jamieson	None	None	lc306;rc308;ae157;cg238;ja376;pk221;Charlie_Kruczko	Liam Crawford;Ross Campbell;Amy Evans;Cameron Grundy;Joss Auty;Payal Karia;Charles Kruczko	ladybird136	Emily Halsey	BBa_K1715000	BBa_K1715999

Fusarium’s airborne spores land on spikelets of flowering crops, producing trichothecene mycotoxins that inhibit cell processes. Gastrointestinal problems and feed refusal in livestock also occur if ingested. However pesticides controlling diseases like FHB have numerous economic and environmental costs.    Our project represents a species specific and widely applicable solution to global agriculture problems using the synthesis of highly pure dsRNA as a topical fungicide. It has been shown that insect midgut cells taking up double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) are processed into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by the Dicer enzyme. If the siRNA is complementary to a certain gene, RNAi can silence its expression. This project will target and silence essential Fusarium genes. Our design involves a scaffold where any dsRNA sequence of interest may be inserted for gene targeting within a specific species.

One factor contributing to CCD is the parasitic mite Varroa destructor, which feeds on bee larva. Current methods used to control V.destructor are inefficient and resistance is developing in treated populations. Using synthetic biology, we designed E.coli that produce the miticide oxalic acid in the bee gut. This method targets V.destructor by directly delivering oxalic acid into the mites, creating mite-proof bee populations.     Biofilms  Bacterial biofilms are the cause of 65% of all hospital acquired infections. Biofilms grow on surfaces of surgical tools and medical implants and are composed of a plaque of bacteria hidden in a matrix of extracellular DNA and sugars. Currents methods used to destroy biofilms are expensive, harsh, and often ineffective. We have created a cocktail of Nuclease and Dextranase designed to degrade the biofilm matrix, allowing for the safe elimination of biofilms.

The existence of ribB will enhance the production of riboflavin. Moreover, riboflavin, as the electron carrier, could improve the electricity producing  performance of the Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs). So in this way, we successfully correlated the concentration of heavy metal ions together with the output voltage of the MFC.

Chlorophyll is a green pigment in photosynthetic organisms that aids in the manufacture of energy. Our aim is to engineer and express 13 genes of the chlorophyll-a biosynthetic pathway from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in E. coli. While this pathway has been well characterised, reproduction of this process in non-photosynthetic organisms has not been successful. Our second goal is to synthetically engineer Photosystem II in E. coli, which consists of 17 genes. Photosystem II is a multi-subunit protein complex that generates oxygen and electrons, by oxidation of water molecules. Transferring these electrons to a hydrogenase would potentially lead to production of hydrogen on an industrial scale.

That is why, we decided to find a solution to this problem by taking kumamolisin and putting it in a vector of yeast that has alpha secretion factor then putting the plasmid in yeast. The yeast will produce and secrete kumamolisin enzyme to its external environment and will destroys gluten  while the bread continues to be fermented. We also prepared a gluten detection kit using green fluroscent protein in PQLP aminoacid sequence. If kumamolisin cuts the gluten it will have cut GFP as well so there will be no colour but if it does not cut the gluten than it also has not cut GFP so green color will be observed.	cagdason	Cagdas D.

However, currently, this technology is severely limited in its applications because protein detection requires a different strategy for each individual protein.  Aptapaper uses the targeting specificity of aptamers to create a modular protein detection system that can easily be adapted to any protein.  A DNA aptamer is bound to a DNA trigger and becomes unbound in response to its protein of specificity. This frees the DNA trigger to turn on an RNA toehold switch, resulting in a 40 fold change in reporter protein expression, with more results to come.

1785	Michigan_Software	University of Michigan	None	Collegiate	iGEM	North America	UNITED STATES	Overgraduate	None	 Software	ProtoCat: Increasing Reproducibility Through Protocol Sharing And Review	Choosing apt and reliable protocols for new experiments is a problem that wet labs routinely face due to the difficulty in anticipating which protocols will produce the best results. Experimental practices may differ immensely across laboratories and precise details of these practices may be lost or forgotten as skilled faculty or students leave the lab to pursue other endeavors. Furthermore, there are few well-defined protocols that are generally agreed upon by the scientific community, in part due to the lack of a system that can supply a measure of a protocol’s acceptance. In order to address these problems, we set out to build a database that integrates a crowd-sourced ratings and comments system to serve as a protocol curator that enables wet lab investigators to compare various protocol efficacies, quantify a protocol’s acceptance within the scientific community, and provide an avenue through which experiential knowledge can be communicated.	mcammer	Marc Ammerlaan	None	None	Cavalcol	James Cavalcoli	None	None	maxgitt;evolver;aturfah;maryweb;alimh;cyore;zachgitt;william123;kaelwill;hydoan;Gwdomini;kmdalman	Max Gittelman;Joshua Abramson;Ali Turfah;Mary Weber;Ali Hammoud;Campbell Yore;Zachary Gittelman;William Schmitt;Katherine Williams;Hy Doan;Graham Dominick;Kaitlin Dalman	schnells	Santiago Schnell	BBa_K1785000	BBa_K1785999

Fire is an oxidation-reduction reaction of chemical process. Flame combustion starts from three main elements, so-called fire triangle, that is, heat, oxygen and fuel.  Fire can expand further by the chain reaction induced by active free radicals made from the combustion. Fire retardant materials have wide applications to slow or even stop the fire. However, the major of these materials are synthesized from chemicals, and many of them have been proven as toxic. As a result, natural biomaterials with fire retardant properties are increasingly important. Casein and wool have been reported as effective fire retardant biomaterials. This year, we are going to analyze the components in casein and wool as well as figure out why they can retard the fire. By this knowledge, we can design and genetically engineer the bacteria to be novel fire retardant biomaterials without toxicity.	f91445122	Pei-Hong Chen	None	None	rkaronnie;0725leowang;PhillyChan;CaptainMaker	Rony Kattukaran Antony;Chang-Chin Wang;Yen-Kuang Chan;Liu Cheng Wei	None	None	Jane12;maggie199967;Rickhahahaha;PerryChu;BrianHR;DreamOne;TonyCJL;AlexxelaTsai;Michelle37;Bonnie88;DanielLiu;Steven1103;Phoebe9125;Joseph_Ho;fredafredaf;Howarch;dxnmb5205;Louis99;jeffrey0706;EdgarChang;klnes2214;timothy0104;RubyLin;Heidicheng;snakegiant;saple2426;tiffany120;bawkbak	Chun-Han Huang;Hsu, Le-Chi;Huang Yung-Jui;CHU, PO-JUI;Chia-Cheng Hsiao;Meng-Yi Li;Chi-Jui ,Liu;SHAO-FU TSAI;Lin-Chen Cheng;Yu-Ting Lin;Yi-Ru Liu;HSU ,PO-CHIH;Chia-Hsuan Chu;HO, JIA-HAN;Yu-Ang, Chang;CHENG, YUAN-HAO;HUNG, BING-LIANG;Min-Chi Chiang;CHEN, CHING-YUAN;CHANG, TSUNG-HSUN;WEI-JUN WANG;Shin-Yue Chen;Heng-Ru Lin;Kai-Hsuan cheng;YUAN-SHIN LIN;Chun-Cheng Chan;Chih-Chien Lee;Ming-Fong Hsieh	DanielBlue	Hao-Wei Lan	BBa_K1608000	BBa_K1608999

Here we demonstrated the utility of this technology in yeast by expressing genes to produce compounds in the beta carotenoid pathway. Furthermore, we have developed a mathematical model to estimate gene order for optimal biosynthetic production using 2A sequence and present it as a community tool to streamline future applications. Finally, accurate and widespread public knowledge regarding the use of genetically modified organisms is vital for increasing social acceptance of synthetic biology.

During the crucial winter months, the fungus wakes bats from hibernation. Affected hibernacula often face mortality rates in excess of 80%, an unsustainable loss in animals which only have one offspring per year. As it spreads, the disease impacts many bat species with roles in pest control and pollination.    Anti-fungal agents are typically indiscriminate, affecting native species which may be beneficial to the bat, while creating a strong selective pressure for future resistance. We have instead decided to develop a system using compounds which slow and inhibit the fungus, giving bats a better fighting chance.    We are modifying E. coli to produce ocimene, a terpene compound in orange fragrance, which has been shown to have inhibitory effects against fungi. We plan to explore enzyme inhibitors and fungal sensing for next year's competition.	shannonk	Katie Shannon	None	None	djwesten	Dave Westenberg	None	None	levipalmer;KMGC65;Xochipilli;kkbyrd;dcshw2;mpq62;kns43b;srshy8;MST_JW;jlhq53;hhk4hf;amj629;cew3n3;NiklasM;cmsgzd;iebrm4;jahf39	Levi Palmer;Kent Gorday;Austin Hall;Kira Buckowing;Daniel Sloan;Meyyammai Palaniappan;Nocona Sanders;Stephanie Soendker;Jiehua Wei;Jessica Hamlett;Hannah Kim;Aaron Jankelow;Claire Wilmore;Niklas Melton;Caitlin Siehr;Isabella Bowling;Joshua Heath	None	None	BBa_K1737000	BBa_K1737999

However, problems regarding stability and efficiency must be overcome to implement co-cultures for CBP on an industrial scale. We aim to produce a robust co-culture by ensuring stable, efficient ratios of bacteria using synthetic intercellular communication. Our co-culture converts agricultural waste, lignocellulose, into a useful product, biodiesel. It consists of Cytophaga hutchinsonii, a cellulolytic bacterium, and Escherichia coli, which is engineered to produce biodiesel. We introduce the LuxI/LuxR/AHL quorum sensing system as the communication pathway between the bacteria. To predict bacterial interactions and design the communication network, we model the dynamics of our co-culture using whole-genome scale metabolic models with dynamic flux balance analysis.  Our project makes co-cultures more viable for industrial consolidated bioprocessing.	rweiss	Ron Weiss	None	None	teague	Brian Teague	None	None	rkchung;mbuss;wguraziu;abajwa;nbrancazio;neighthan;ashtishah;jdgibson;mollybrennan;niamshah;jadude26;ady;Sivateja	Ryan Chung;Marjorie Buss;Wendi Guraziu;Ayesha Bajwa;Nicholas Brancazio;Nathan Hunt;Ashti Shah;Jesse Gibson;Molly Brennan;Niam Shah;Joshua Charles Woodard;Alyssa Dayan;Sivateja Tangirala	Viirj	Viirj Kan	BBa_K1705000	BBa_K1705999

Embedded proteins, invisible to the naked eye, are then visualized by staining. Among the various staining techniques, silver staining is easy to perform and highly sensitive. However, the outcome is a series of monochromatic protein bands. Previously, we observed that some proteins inherently produce different hues post-staining. We hypothesized that specific amino acid configurations yield coloured bands after reacting with silver staining reagents. To test our hypothesis, we created numerous amino acid motifs to elucidate the sequences that would generate specific colours following silver staining. Our findings will let us generate a molecular weight marker with the innate capacity of providing users colour-coded bands post-staining without the use of impregnating dyes. Our technology will also pave the way for new types of colorimetric assays using synthetic proteins.

Here by using Bacillus subtilis as a bioreactor, we are working to devise a way to absorb and retrieve heavy metals. A “Metallosniper” targeted at lead, gold and uranium has been successfully engineered. With the feature of producing endospores, we have made it possible for B. subtilis to absorb heavy metals under both benign conditions and adverse circumstances. In a gesture to further improve the efficiency of binding metals, biofilm, cell surface-display system and degradable materials for immobilization are applied in our project.

The system is designed to be activated and deactivated via light- regulated fusion proteins, which then active protein synthesis to complete the process. The information storage would be accomplished by conjugation, which cannot be carried out in usual time because of the specific gene deletion. When the memory needs to be erased, the CRISPR-Cas9 system in the “Saver” would be activated.    By design such a cellular memory technology, we make a bacterial memory storage device. And together with biological transistor and other bio-electronic component, we can preview the prototype of the biological computer.

The goal of this project is to develop a strategy to treat opioid addiction. We prepared exosomes (nano-sized vesicles secreted by endogenous cells) from cell factory that was engineered to express a rabies viral glycoprotein peptide (specifically recognize and target neuronal cells) on the exosomal membrane surface. By filling the exosomes with siRNA of the mu opioid receptor (MOR, a primary target for opioids) and injecting the exosomes into mouse bloodstream, we detected efficient passage of the siRNA through blood-brain barrier and specific accumulation of the siRNA in mouse brain. Consequently, siRNA-loaded exosomes significantly reduced MOR mRNA and protein levels in mice. To show the therapeutic potential, siRNA-loaded exosomes strongly restrained morphine-induced conditioned place preference in mice. This project may open up new avenues for future treatment of drug addiction.

Studies suggest that resistant starches may reduce colon cancer by enabling colonic bacteria to produce short-chain fatty acids, including butyrate.  Our project took two approaches to increase colonic butyrate. The first approach was to develop a screen for enzymes that could transfer acyl/butyryl groups to alpha 1,4 carbohydrates in bacteria and plants. To support this we modelled and modified carbohydrate branching. Enzymatic modification of carbohydrates could also provide environmentally-friendly methods for the production of modified starches used in a wide range of industries. The second approach aimed to transfer the butyrate biosynthetic pathway to Escherichia coli.  Our work could be applied to the production of butyrylated starches for consumption as prebiotics or butyrate-producing probiotics. We also investigated and compared the feasibility of testing these products for efficacy in humans.

Hence, there is an urgent need to explore alternative energy sources that are renewable and affordable. A microbial fuel cell (MFC) is an attractive solution to the global energy crisis. It is a device that utilizes microorganisms to convert chemical energy stored in various organic or inorganic compounds to electrical current. In our project, we seek to explore the usage of Shewanella bacteria in MFCs. We are performing flux balance analysis on the metabolic network of Shewanella and are genetically perturbing different nodes in the network to determine if the power output of the MFC can be enhanced. Additionally, we are developing and characterizing new genetic parts to aid us in our engineering of the Shewanella bacteria.	menghow	Meng How Tan	None	None	zhengjie_ntu;lzhang021	Jie Zheng;Zhang Lei	None	None	cht009;bychong;tkoh002;OOIK0003;yinyuan1_1;qchoo001;lyyzbo;myang012;mwong007	Chen Haoting;Chong Bao Yi;Koh Tracy;Ooi Kean Hean;Yin Yuan;Nicholas Choo;Luo Yuanyuan;Yang Ming;Ming Jie Wong	shuobo;abhishek017	shuobo shi;abhishek jain	BBa_K1676000	BBa_K1676999

However, lacking of the compartmentation of the heterologous metabolic enzymes may cause a low production or efficacy of the product, especially when producing through a complex multi-enzymatic cascade. In this study, we developed a new method to accelerate a multi-enzymatic reaction by integration of a TALE-based scaffold system into the bacteria chassis. In this system, different TALE proteins, which could specifically target the corresponding DNA binding motifs, were generated and fused with fragmented GFP or multi-enzymes (e.g., IAAM and IAAH). The results showed that TALE-based scaffold system could not only efficiently guide the fragmented GFP around the DNA scaffolds and display strong fluorescence, but also promote the rate of IAA production. To our knowledge, this technique might provide a powerful way in synthesizing multi-enzymatic reaction programs in prokaryotic chassis for a wide range of application.	lyzhucn	Zhu Lingyun	None	None	Zhulvyun;wuxiaomin;KevinLiu;LongLiu;ShaoliangPeng	Zhu Lvyun;Wu Xiaomin;Qijun Liu;Liu Long;Shaoliang Peng	None	None	qiuxinyuan12;PatriciaXie;Rose;Iamstillbreathing;Sunjiaqi13;zhaangyuan13;fandongyu13;huangjuanjuan;wade;jiaodadongluwyzh;zhuchushu13	Xinyuan Qiu;Nianhao Xie;Qianhui  Zhu;Xin Li;Jiaqi Sun;Yuan Zhang;Dongyu Fan;Juanjuan Huang;Jie Li;Yizhou Wang;Chushu Zhu	None	None	BBa_K1789000	BBa_K1789999

ComX stimulates the transcription of the genes essential for competence.  However, there is a chance to reduce ComX level by overexpressing its novel antagonist,  XrpA. The highly expressed level of XrpA protein leads to decreased biofilm formation. Our project aims two goals.  The first one is to overexpress the production of XrpA in order to cease the production of ComX protein. The second one will implement CRISPR-dCas9 system in order to block the transcription of VicK gene. VicK is the gene of VicK/VicR signal transduction system in S.mutans that is responsible for acidity tolerance in bacteria. Thus, second system will combine sgRNA for VicK and dCas9 to reduce lactic acid production.

Potato, the third most important food crop in the world and a source of major agricultural income in many countries, easily falls victim to P. infestans. Yet most existing approaches are ineffective and have certain drawbacks. This year, the NYMU-Taipei iGEM team creates a systematic disease control method that can prevent, detect, and cure potato late blight. Inspired by competitive inhibition in pharmacology, we designed a ligand with higher affinity to block the entrance of P. infestans effector proteins. To detect infection in the plant, we devised a soil-based microbial fuel cell (SMFC) detecting salicylic acid emission and producing oscillating current. We also characterized a new defensin to inhibit nutrient absorption and further growth of the oomycete. Our goal is to provide an easily-practiced standard procedure for anyone involved in the production line.	nymuchang	Chuan-Hsiung Chang	None	None	JChangym;TASTigers	Ching-Fen Chang;Jude C.

The trap attracts mosquitoes by secreting indole and lactic acid, both of which are highly attractive to a broad range of mosquitoes. Indole is produced from tryptophan by E.coli with the genes tnaA and tnaB. Similarly, lactic acid is produced from fructose by E. coli with the gene lldD.     After being attracted by the two organic compounds and flying into the trap, the mosquitoes will be stunned and electrocuted by an electric mesh. They will fall onto the medium containing the E.coli. The hard exoskeleton of the mosquitoes is digested by chitinase (produced by the gene ChiA in E.coli). With the hard outer exoskeletons removed, the mosquitoes serve as a carbon source to maintain E. coli’s growth, hence creating a self-sustaining system. We hope that this trap will provide a cheap, sustainable alternative to current mosquito traps.

When exposed to electromagnetic field, the ferric oxihydroxide core would be heated, which would trigger thermosensitive regulator.    For thermosensitive regulator, we chose RNA thermometer and constructed a thermosensitive T7 RNA polymerase. RNA thermometer is a structured RNA which could expose RBS only when heated.

In a process known as ""quorum sensing,"" bacteria both secrete and sense autoinducer signaling molecules to enable synchronization of group gene expression paradigms. The synthetic biology community has rapidly adopted these quorum signaling pathways for use in programmed circuitry. However, chemical signals must diffuse between sender and receiver cells, limiting such communication to a common environment. In electronics, when electrical signals must be transferred between two circuits operating at incompatible voltages, electrical engineers use optocouplers, components that transfer information between isolated circuits via light. The 2015 Penn iGEM team presents a biological analog of the optocoupler, a cell-to-cell communication system in which a ""sender"" cell generates light via bioluminesence and a ""receiver"" cell expresses photoreceptors to enable light-dependent physiological responses. We show that light elicits a response in light-sensitive receivers and illuminated potential applications for this alternative form of cell communication."	UPenn_Adviser	Brian Y.

In the absence of positive feedback loops these systems are unstable since they require the maintained presence of a regulator. DNA switches based on heritable genetic modifications can allow for a permanent change in gene expression even in the absence of the initial signal. The Cre-Lox recombinase system from the P1 bacteriophage has been successfully used in genetic manipulation to excise targeted DNA fragments. Our aim is to use the Cre-Lox recombinase system to trigger a heritable genetic switch that allows for irreversible ON/OFF programming as an alternative to positive feedback loops.

A common biofuel practice is to sequester lignin using energy-intensive thermal pretreatment. The recent development of a synthetic yeast that spatially separates lignin degradation products from vulnerable BDEs enables an efficient lignin breakdown system to reduce the energy input for biofuel production. By expressing enzymes from lignin-degrading species (termites and white rot fungi), we aim to establish a novel enzymatic pretreatment system in a yeast chassis. Six enzymes were selected for their ability to operate at room temperature and standard pH. The expressed enzymes were evaluated individually and in combination for lignin-degradation efficiency.

This is met with an ongoing shortage of donor organs, in part, limited     by preservation technologies. A human heart can currently be stored for 6 hours     before significant tissue damage results in a non-viable organ. QGEM aims to     use antifreeze proteins (AFPs), natural proteins that enable certain organisms to     survive in sub-zero climates, to rectify this limitation. We have engineered two     classes of AFPs focused on improving protein function and stability, respectively.     Our primary objective has been the development of an anchoring system to     increase local concentration of AFPs by attachment to a self-assembling scaffold.     This system increases the probability of favorable interaction with ice surfaces     thereby improving AFP activity. Our secondary project structurally modifies an     AFP, enabling the protein to withstand a more diverse chemical environment.     This increases potential industrial applications in food and energy sectors.	jallingham	John Allingham	None	None	None	None	None	None	Kersh.T;11mhe2;JoannaS;JuliaG;Danielle_QGEM;11jr45;mlitschko;jtanwani;Dragos.Chiriac;CandiceT;12af3	Kersh Theva;Malak Elbatarny;Joanna Semrau;Julia Grein;Danielle Ciren;Justine Ring;Morgan Litschko;Jaya Tanwani;Dragos S.

Our construct expresses three proteins: OspA, which binds to the tick's TROSPA in the gut and prevents Lyme infection, Wolbachia Surface Protein, which allows for vertical transmission of the Live Vaccine bacteria and it also tempers the insect’s immune system, and GFP, which is used as an indicator protein. The construct is transfected in DH5Alpha E. Coli and it is tested in Drosophila (to check for vertical transmission) before being inserted into ticks. Since Lyme disease is not the only vector-born disease originated in insects, this Live Vaccine can be used for other diseases such as West Nile Virus, Dengue, Malaria, Yellow Fever etc .

But agricultural uses of antibiotics produce environmental exposures in a variety of reservoirs, which are impossible to be guarded against. Our group has developed a simple, reliable and efficient method to measure the antibiotics.Our Tetracycline biosensor can detect the tetracycline residues in agricultural products (such as: meat, eggs, milk, etc.). Our group constructed the tetracycline inducible expression system. And through plasmid mediated, the system was transfected into Escherichia coli TOP10 and GS115 Pichia pastoris.

It is noticeable that CO2 and N2 occupy almost 98% of Martian atmosphere. Thus, we engineered two types of E.coli, which carry out anaerobic carbon fixation with Acetyl-CoA Synthetase/Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase(ACS/CODH) system, and nitrogen fixation with Paenibacillus nitrogenase respectively. Based on this purpose, they are called E. Pangu collectively, which is named after the creator of universe, Pan Gu in Chinese mythology.

Antibodies have many applications in research, diagnostics, and show great promise in treatment of cancer. But the advancement is held back due to the expensive and tiresome production. Therefore we propose an alternative to antibodies; peptide aptamers – produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli). The variable loop of the peptide aptamer is generated through a random nucleotide library and held together by an enzymatic inactive version of human Thioredoxin (hThx) as a scaffold protein. We are using the bacterial two-hybrid system to screen for functioning peptide aptamers that are able to bind our chosen target proteins (‘antigens’). In this model bacteria expressing a functioning peptide aptamer will express Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP), which enables us to isolate them. To challenge the antibody tradition, we are also proposing a production model.

There are already some methods to convert saltwater into freshwater, such as distillation and reverse osmosis. However, the high energy consumption of these technologies has limited their application. Therefore the development of an innovative, low-energy biological desalination process, by biological membranes of cyanobacteria, would be very attractive. Many cyanobacteria possess salt-tolerance mechanisms, among which sodium export is the most important one. Halorhodopsin is a light-driven inward-directed chloride pump from halobacteria. We will functionally express it in cyanobacteria to drive influx of chloride together with sodium, thus conferring cyanobacteria the ability to absorb salts to a significant degree.	helin	Lin He	None	None	magang;FlyFreedom	Gang Ma;Renhe Luo	None	None	gefee1;EvaJiang;Revu.Bu;Plutohalo;Kariny888;Chaojiajia;sjy94;wy;Ethel;yincan518;yuanhang;mashiro;hilary;KelvinLu_	Gefei Han;Yiwen Jiang;Xiangdong Bu;Yifan Xu;Karin Yanagi;Jiajia Chao;Jianye Shi;Yan Wang;Jie Sun;Can Yin;Hang Yuan;Anqi Chen;CAO LIANYING;Guangzhen Lv	sunflosoda;Shajia;rezaulbiox;ManxiZhu	Yushu Wang;SHAJIA AFRIN;Md.

In nature, bacteria of Clostridium genus have been shown to produce butanol from butanoic acid. In the present study, C. acetobutylicum metabolic pathway for butanol production was introduced into E. coli via a construct, consisting of three genes (CtfA, CtfB and BdhB). Polypeptide CtfAB converts butyrate to butyryl-CoA, which is then transformed to butanol by means of BdhB dehydrogenase. Butyrate is formed as an intermediate product in a reaction pathway of direct biological conversion of waste. We successfully composed an optimized system of bioreactors to produce pure butanol and use all side products formed. In the first stage the waste is converted to biogas, natural fertilizer and butyrate, the latter being efficiently transformed to biobutanol in the second stage.	gasano	Ilja Gasan Osojnik Crnivec	None	None	MDolinar;mklemencic;api2003	Marko Dolinar;Marina Klemencic;Albin Pintar	None	None	anamilovanovic;kulovec;NinaJerala;ZalaSekne;marisa.cvitanic;anze21;azupancic;jernej.savli	Ana Milovanovic;Domen Kulovec;Nina Jerala;Zala Sekne;Marisa Cvitanic;Anze Vozelj;Ales Zupancic;Jernej Savli	None	None	BBa_K1669000	BBa_K1669999

Facultative anaerobic bacteria possess the ability to colonise the tumour core, and pose as suitable vectors. To ensure specific control of bacterial vectors, we intend to implement a two switch regulatory system, consisting of an anaerobic-responsive FNR promoter and a quorum-sensing system (QS).     An anaerobic-responsive FNR promoter can be used to localise transcription of the target gene in the hypoxic tumor core. The second switch will use the esa QS system from Pantoea stewartii to activate bacterial density induced transcription of genes. The above two systems could be coupled to drive the expression of invasin and listeriolysin, which facilitate bacterial invasion and endosomal escape into the cell cytosol. The bacteria vehicle would then be able to deliver an encoded therapeutic into the target tumour cells.	lgapter	Leslie A.

We are harnessing the replicative properties of biology to create biOrigami—biological, self-folding origami—to reduce the mass, volume, and assembly time of materials needed for space missions. biOrigami consists of two main components: manufacturing substrates biologically and bioengineering folding mechanisms. For substrates, we are developing new BioBricks to synthesize two thermoplastics: polystyrene and polyhydroxyalkanoates. For folding mechanisms, we are using heat-induced contraction of thermoplastics and the contractile properties of bacterial spores. After consulting with experts, we believe that biOrigami could be incorporated into rovers, solar sails, and more. In addition to biOrigami, we are creating a novel method to efficiently transform bacteria by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, benefitting the broader synthetic biology community.

Despite great advances in high-throughput technologies and the discovery of several hundred new disease biomarkers, we are currently still unable to detect diseases specifically and sensitively when they are most vulnerable, at the beginning. We want to develop a transferable, biological detection system for different diseases using HER-2, a breast cancer biomarker, for a proof-of-prinicple. Therefore, we created a novel class of chimeric receptors based on the bacterial osmoregulator EnvZ. We substituted a part of the periplasmic domain of EnvZ with an exchangable, but highly-specific protein binder, an Affibody molecule. Upon antigen binding, the receptor would trigger the OmpR signaling cascade leading to the production of quorom sensing molecules which activate transcription of a fluorescent signal in a separated read-out strain. Taken together, this system could be a transferable method for biomarker detection.	johanr	Johan Rockberg	None	None	terfri;hakan.jonsson;uterom	teresa frisan;Haakan Joensson;Ute Römling	None	None	katrineHI;pontushojer;cleete;utsakarmakar;ABergenstråle;Shea.Baxley;Destr;monahassan;aerugo;sarahwideman;linneaos;radny91;manonricard;hugoimt9;carmen.g.alvarez;karkugv14;Karl.Annusver;mkarla;lilienmeer	Katrine Horne Iversen;Pontus Höjer;Felix Clemens Richter;Utsa Karmakar;Axel Bergenstråle;Alison Shea Baxley;Denise Strand;Mona Hassan;Hugi Asgeirsson;Sarah Wideman;Linnea Österberg;Radoslaw Jakub Gora;Manon Ricard;Hugo Ivan Morales Tello;Carmen Gallo Álvarez;Karol Kugiejko;Karl Annusver;Maximilian Karlander;Naz Karadag	rdraheim	Roger Draheim	BBa_K1766000	BBa_K1766999

We aim to create a durable system that can independently regulate blood glucose levels to prevent hyperglycemic crises and improve the quality of life of type II diabetics. We engineered E. coli that can detect changes in blood osmolarity and release pharmacologically active tripeptides in response. The tripeptides act on the kidneys by inhibiting the SGLT1 and SGLT2, two channels proteins that re-uptake glucose out of the urine. By inhibiting this reabsorption, the body is able to excrete excess glucose to counteract hyperglycemia. As of now, our system relies on a general sensor for blood osmolarity, but future studies will implement a more specific sensor for glucose through a modification of the lac operon.	jpgergen	J.

Pathogens have evolved to develop resistance towards antibiotics, which is the common option for treatment. Antibiotic mode of treatment can be replaced by bacteriocins. Bacteriocins are novel peptides synthesised by an organism and have specific detrimental effects on the surrounding microbial community. These peptides can be produced by minicells which are achromosomal cells formed due to aberrant cell division, in this case induced by the overexpression of ftsZ. Pseudomonas aeruginosa will be used as the model organism for our studies.  This strategy can also be used against organisms in biofilms. We have planned to study the effect of bacteriocins on Staphylococcus aureus which is the major organism in biofilm. Further we extend our work to a range of applications like strain selection, preventing botulism and animal husbandry.	sivanandham	Prof. M.

Coli	The enzyme ethene monooxygenase (EtnABCD) catalyses the epoxide reaction that converts ethylene to ethylene oxide by incorporating a hydroxyl group. EtnABCD is of great interest for biocatalytic epoxide production to replace current organic chemistry methods which present safety and environmental concerns.  Mycobacterium smegmatis is the only organism that endogenously expresses ethene monooxygenase, yet is a poor cloning host. To enhance the heterologous expression of the EtnABCD enzyme, a mathematical model was developed taking into account the differences in codon frequencies between organisms. The M. smegmatis gene encoding EtnABCD was modified using this model in order to obtain optimized sequences for expression in both Pseudomonas putida, as an intermediate host, and Escherichia coli. The altered EtnABCD sequences will be cloned into appropriate vector inserts. Once stable expression of EtnABCD is established in Pseudomonas putida, the E. coli optimized sequence will be expressed to give a high activity monooxygenase enzyme.

Without co-development and an open, proof-of-principle engineering platform, it is hard for synthetic biologists to manage this complexity. To address this problem, we developed CORE, an open and extensible software that allows users to design, share and cooperate in synthetic biology. CORE mainly consists of two closely interconnected modules. One is the open, crowdsourcing platform. It helps users design and redesign, share and reuse previous work according to the principle of modularized design. The other one is the design module embedded in the platform, which promotes genetic design automation based on ODE (ordinary differential equation) models and assists wet-lab practices through protocol management. In conclusion, the combination of a crowdsourcing platform and a novel design module makes complex design more accessible to synthetic biologists.	sysu_software	JianHua Yang	None	None	yanyanzhhiro;RenJian;Legionella;hshengf2;lnszyd;Hexionglei;zhlingl	Yan Zhang;Jian Ren;Yongjun Lu;Shengfeng Huang;Yongdong Zhang;Xionglei He;Lingling Zheng	None	None	f296754370;WilliamChui;paradise924715;yxryxr;Lemonie;Nanyao;daishengkun;Frozenfish;qq494779656;hezhilusysu;leasunhy;Liang Tang;Tianyu Meng;Jiajian Liang;Lihui Dong;Xiangyue Hu;Shaofan Lai;Zhengyang Wen;Jiaqi Ye;Qianhui Wan;Sicheng Luo	Xiao Feng;Weilin Xu;Li Jiajin;Xiaoran Yang;Yi Shi;Nan Yao;Shengkun Dai;Dongyu Zeng;Jinjin Lin;Zhilu He;Siyuan Liu;hahamty;liangjj37;ThebestLihui;Phalloidin;ShaofanLai;DannyWen;YEIGEM;stellamberV;lsc	Peng Nie;Xiangwan LU	nie1234567;luxiangwan	BBa_K1591000	BBa_K1591999

Also, microbes with the system inserted acquire the concept of life span so that some dangerous bacterias will come to death in time before they cause any biohazard. Inverted components which based on recombinase system are introduced in our system. One inverted component is able to calculate a period of time, while several inverted components comprise of one time cycle. When we combine several time cycles together, a sequence with a timer's function has been successfully formed. Through altering recombinases and their specific sites to different matches, we can get distinctive time cycles. We believe that the system will be of great importance to biological devices with time-related concepts.

In response to inflammation or tumors, Granzyme B is overexpressed and enters target cells to induce apoptosis. However, high levels of Granzyme B also result in random cleavage of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, such as elastin and decorin, which help to maintain tissue structure and elasticity. Our team has constructed a system that inhibits Granzyme B activity in the ECM without affecting its intracellular functions. In humans, Antichymotrypsin (ACT) is an extracellular protease inhibitor, which we have modified to allow for Granzyme B inhibition. Of the many diseases associated with ECM degradation, we focus on preventing damage from both arthritis and prolonged wound healing. We've engineered a semipermeable bandage to deliver the Granzyme B inhibitor topically without bacterial contamination. Our system is capable of maintaining a healthy immune system response while protecting ECM proteins.	TASTigers	Jude C.

The introduction of genetic material into different cell types is indispensable for the creation of genetically modified organisms which provide different benefits to society. However some techniques used for gene delivery into the cells have low efficiencies, can be expensive, or use complex equipment and are complicated to do. That is why in recent years it has sought new strategies for effective transformation of cells at low cost. One of these strategies is the use of nanotechnology, which has the potential of crossing cell membranes and increase solubility, stability and bioavailability of biomolecules, thereby improving efficiency of release.

Its molecular structure gives it unique physical and chemical characteristics. One method to synthesize graphene involves the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) into functionalized graphene (rGO). This method requires the use of dangerous chemicals that threatens the environment and our health so its use is limited only to laboratories that produce it in small scale. We were able to successfully reduce GO into rGO using an organic molecule derived from glucose and evaluate the physical properties of the obtained rGO. Our plan is to transform P. pastoris GS115 so it can express glucose oxidase (GOD) and gluconolactone oxidase (GLO) enzymes and the reducing agent can be synthesized from glucose. We hope that this project’s results allow the production at an industrial level of graphene in order to help trigger the technological revolution of graphene.	mmroca	Maria Mercedes Roca	None	None	LFGM;CynFranco	Luis Garcia;Cynthia Franco	None	None	rhernandez;vicente.armenta;MiguelAzori;mtb1508;monsegd;nora9196;rvfelipe;Reginarendon;Sepava;Luluugo;P.Rellstab	Ricardo Hernández Medina;Vicente Paúl Armenta Pérez;Miguel A.

Our project is focused on another Janus - hydrophobin the protein, who looks to the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity. Because of this, a sea of new applications are created. Firstly, we re-designed the structures of two classes of hydrophobins, making expression in E.coli possible. Secondly, we use its double-sticky-tape-like ability to make two applications. We take this advantage to fix antibodies on a high-flux tumor detection chip. Meanwhile, they are used to catch cutinases for plastic degradation. We even make them into a fusion to test if the enhancement could be better. Thirdly, we use its amphipathicity to achieve protein separation, where they act as a special purification tag, and the system could be as simple as polymer, detergent and water. With help of this, we could even achieve recovery of cutinases.	yanghttju	Haitao Yang	None	None	wangzftju	Zefang Wang	None	None	Sherry222;wwwccttoo;BuryLove;sunny_tsxb;wh101954;yxy;Taylor_Chen;ClarenceWang;MarzHan;LIUJIASHU;YigePeng;YJJ;TJUzhangyuwei;Carol_Han;Antonia;zousitanghulu;chiheng;hswangyang;endless;fgxhh;wanghaofeng;13821754553	Dongqi Bao;Ketong Shao;Shubin Li;Qing Zhao;Hua Wang;Xiangyu Yin;Zexiang Chen;Chenmao Wang;Xuan Han;LIU JIASHU;Yige Peng;Junjie Yu;Yuwei Zhang;Bowen Han;Xuemei Dong;Yifan Zhang;Chi Heng;wang yang;Zong Junjie;Jinxin Hu;Haofeng Wang;Yuchen Li	None	None	BBa_K1582000	BBa_K1582999

Recent efforts to address environmental pollution converge towards bioremediation as the most promising solution. While endogenous bacteria such as Pseudomonas Putida F1 can degrade toluene, we optimized E. coli to be more efficient at breaking down 3-methylcatechol, a rate-limiting step in the toluene degradation pathway. We did so by creating 2 plasmids that once co-transformed into E. coli would achieve the metabolization of toluene down to water and carbon dioxide. Additionally, a web application for visualizing, manipulating, and comparing genome-scale metabolic models of bacterial consortia was developed and used to analyse the introduction of our synthetic E. coli into the Athabasca river microbiome. We have created a framework to analyze the optimal solution to the problem present, by considering designs, associated cost profiles, and political risks in the context of Alberta’s soil sand industry.	bsteipe	Boris Steipe	None	None	None	None	None	None	jialunchen;ceesu;jmazz;niralipatel;Urvashi_6;c4Rex;sbarot22;cicekser;chande23;waleedkhan;Tsmnbx;yjsong01;ymsong01;KatJae;seanout;tt6746690;sammyzheng;umar.owadally;ghazalh;anthonyzhao;michael_dao;albert.cui;albert3366;jshelenalim;dowdellj;christinebyrd;GargiG;caoquynh;leeroy2;biobriceric;Krossfire;sarahbi;PavelSH;fahmeeda;Altima;Joohyun;vivian.zhou;cheemaa;cheema	Jialun Tom Chen;Cathy Su;Julian Mazzitelli;Nirali Patel;Urvashi Rathod;Xiuqi (Rex) Xia;Shivali Barot;Seray Cicek;Derrick Hm Chan;Waleed Khan;Joshua Efe;Justin Yongju Song;Julian Yongmin Song;Katariina Jaenes;Sean Ihn;Peiqi Wang;yixin zheng;Umar Ibrahim Owadally;Ghazal Haddad;Anthony Zhao;Michael Dao;Aobo Cui;Albert Calzaretto;Helena Lim;Joanna Dowdell;Christine Byrd;Gargi Ghosh;Quynh Cao;Roy Lee;Eric Jadidzadeh;ChungMin Lee;Sarah Haixin Bi;Pavel Shmatnik;Fahmeeda Murtaza;Aïda Liman-Tinguiri;Alexander Sullivan;Vivian Zhou;Dawood Cheema;Dawood Cheema	None	None	BBa_K1760000	BBa_K1760999

Such fungal infections significantly reduce sustainability and food production in developing countries, where lack of advanced food storage and mycotoxin exposure are responsible for severe economic losses and 40% of diseases. As such, our team focused on developing a secretable chitinase capable of hydrolysing the glycosidic bonds which compose the polysaccharide chitin, a key structural component in fungal cellular walls. By fusing LbCHI31 chitinase-encoding genes with a secretion signal peptide from alpha-amylase, we successfully generated an escherichia coli line that secretes chitinase specific to fusarium oxysporum, a major pathogenic fungi. LbCHI31 extracellular secretion and effectiveness were further quantified through characterization and analysis. This project will allow for easily accessible, cost-effective methods for producing effective chitinases that combat fungal infections, thereby increasing crop yield, stabilizing financial growth, and reducing famine globally.	emilyqu2003	Justin Kang	None	None	None	None	None	None	nlian;danem;czhang12;Achakraborty;jqixuan;olol909;Zerxis;KangA.roo;priya1316;Gita5683;rimnathan99;exiang;richardn;supahotfire;jodie824;arimkang;jwang9930;msong99;jonathan.kuo12;cjung;rachellian7;erica.hwang2000	Nathan Lian;Dane Malangone;Caroline Zhang;Abhishek Chakraborty;Qixuan Jin;Aidan Kahng;Patricia Ouyang;Anthony Kang;Priyanka Multani;Gitanjali Multani;Nathan Rim;Edric Xiang;Richard Ni;Daniel Rim;Jodie Hoh;Andrew Rim;Jonathan Wang;Madeline Song;Jonathan Kuo;Catherine Jung;Rachel Lian;Yeawon Hwang	None	None	BBa_K1788000	BBa_K1788999

Artemisinin is currently the front line treatment for malaria, a disease transmitted in the bites of Anopheles mosquitoes. One of the deadliest diseases in human history, malaria now claims over 600,000 lives a year. The majority of these lives are young children, and residents of developing countries, where people are unable to afford the drug. Our mission is to investigate the production of affordable antimalarial drugs. Our team is working with artemisinic acid producing e-coli cells, obtained from Amyris, with the support of Zagaya.

Through the On/Off commands from light switchers, genetic manipulation can be achieved when diverse combinations of light signal are provided. Specifically, three light-mediated platforms are established: bio-imaging platform, genetic editing platform and information storage platform. For the first part, the expression of fluorescent protein can be precisely controlled by the incoming light, forming pre-determined image pattern with drastically high resolutions. For the second part, dCas9 and DNA-binding-domain-deleted recombinase are linked together to smoothly alter genetic information without introducing double strand breaks. For the third part, artificial information can be stored and retrieved easily via light-mediated systems.     We designed CRISPR-recombinase screening systems, measured fluorescent protein expression parameters and developed a light-emitting electronic device to support our project.

In order to permanently memorise the sensor state of the snapshot time point in cells we use an altered version of the DNA recombinase Cre to switch on a luciferase reporter. The ability to quickly capture the current state of the sensor is achieved by fusing Cre with two copies of the protein Dronpa, that oligomerises after illumination and thereby cages and inhibits the recombinase. Because the oligomerisation of Dronpa is reversible through another wavelength, we can control the activity of the recombinase and fine tune the read out of the luciferase reporter.

This will entail the delivery of the Cas9 endonuclease and guide RNAs through the cell membrane and into the nuclei of somatic cells such that double-stranded breaks can be induced at the desired loci. We seek to leverage the cellular penetration capabilities of the atoxic Clostridium difficile toxin B (aTcdB) which very efficiently mediates endocytosis and escapes endosomal capture. By adding Cas9 upstream of the catalytically inactive glucosyltransferase domain of the toxin, we hope to develop a recombinant fusion protein that will deliver into the cytoplasm an NLS-tagged Cas9 bound to a guide RNA. We aim to express the Cas9-aTcdB protein in Bacillus megaterium, transcribe the guide RNAs in vitro, and incubate this complex with HeLa cell cultures to excise a repressor and allow GFP to be expressed.	nunair	Nikhil Nair	None	None	None	None	None	None	cmbrine;ckuhner13;kwilli05;13arinn;mzalesne;pcavanagh;Andrade;denalirao;Vintus;MichaelGannon;jimkim;hcarabello;Sam2e;lucasbbrown1;m.gold;arayfield;schuylerlink	Connor McBrine;Christopher Kuhner;Katherine Williams;Arin Naidu;Michael Zalesne;Peter Cavanagh;Andrade Hendricks;Denali Rao;Vintus Okonkwo;Michael James Gannon;Jim E.

The technique allows the production of almost any imaginable structure. A variety of 3D-printing methods have been developed, for instance Stereolithography (SLA) - enabling the realization of many utilization options. We produce monomer compounds in E.coli, nominal xylitol, itaconic acid and ethylene glycol by metabolic engineering. Those compounds were combined by a chemical hydrolysis reaction creating a pre-polymer. The final polymerization reaction is promoted when defined light waves hit the pre-polymer liquid transforming it into a solid polymer. We want to use this technology to advance medical engineering. In cooperation with Synenergene, we developed an application scenario to identify the best way to provide an accurate on-site matching prosthesis to victims of forced amputations.

Although many biosensors have already become available, a universal biosensor platform is lacking. As a first step towards such a platform, we are introducing a transmembrane biosensor which may in the future be incorporated into signaling pathways. The system is characterized by three modules, aptamers as recognition elements, outer-membrane proteins as the scaffold and signaling components which can translate ligand binding into a measurable signal through heterodimerization. Aptamers can be clicked onto the outer membrane proteins post-translationally using SPAAC click-chemistry, making the system inherently modular. The biosensors can be employed in a wide range of applications: from detecting biomarkers to the overuse of pesticides. We believe that in the future, the system can go beyond its function as a biosensor and may be able to trigger cellular responses.	mmerkx	Maarten Merkx	None	None	tfadgreef	Tom De Greef	None	None	hansdeferrante;femke.vaassen;Yeshi;s136969;s138207;Laura.Jacobs;Kwankwan;s138200;Sjoerdn;Jan_Willem;CasvanderPutten	Hans de Ferrante;Femke Vaassen;Yeshi de Bruin;Laura van Smeden;Elles Elschot;Laura Jacobs;Sing Kwan Zhu;Esther van Leeuwen;Sjoerd Nooijens;Jan-Willem Muller;Cas van der Putten	None	None	BBa_K1761000	BBa_K1761999

Producing recombinant proteins of high purity and free of toxic compounds is a hallmark.   For this purpose we generated a series of constructs with tagged superfolder GFP proteins expressed under the control of promoters for non-toxic sugar inducers: arabinose, melibiose, rhamnose and xylose. We have focused on promoters, because these minimal, independent regulators of expression levels are important tools for synthetic biology to build complex but still compact genetic systems.

Currently, there exist no working 24-hour oscillator BioBricks. We are addressing this problem by transplanting the circadian rhythm-generating KaiABC system from cyanobacteria into E. coli and optimizing its function by controlling protein stoichiometry and adding accessory proteins. Such a BioBrick would be important for any application in which gene expression needs to be regulated on a 24-hour schedule. For example, it is often important to release a drug at a specific time of the day. As a proof-of-concept application, we implemented this clock as a potential solution to jet lag and sleep disorders by engineering a strain of E. coli that facilitates the production of a melatonin precursor in the gut on a 24-hour cycle. Thus, our project demonstrates the application of a robust KaiABC-based clock in timed drug dosage, as well as introduces an oscillator BioBrick into the synthetic biology community.	mrust	Michael Rust	None	None	jwchew	Justin Chew	None	None	mpantuck;mansic;ethan.steinberg24;azhangkt;shivak;esjoya;analrapist;ryans17;Benjaminh;davinam717;RBeckner;dbgasaway	morgan pantuck;Mansi Chandra;Ethan Steinberg;Annie Zhang;Shiva Kangeyan;Eliot Joya;Kevin Yang;Ryan Singh;Benjamin Hsu;Davina Moossazadeh;Ryan Beckner;Derek Gasaway	None	None	BBa_K1745000	BBa_K1745999

By measuring the rate at which triclosan inhibits Fabi, we can make a standard curve of percent inhibition vs triclosan, and use this standard curve to determine how much triclosan is present in a wastewater sample. We are investigating the activity of the Fabi enzyme from 8 different organisms on a panel of non-native substrates to determine the combination of Fabi and substrate that will yield the best results at the lowest cost. We can then engineer the enzyme to have greater specificity on the non-native substrate through computational design and kunkel mutagenesis.

The ability to stoichiometrically control enzyme levels allows for empirical testing of rate limiting steps. As a proof of principle, we tested our ability to identify rate limiting steps using the bacterial LUX system, a bioluminescent reaction, in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. We have expressed several permutations of the bacterial LUX metabolic pathway to empirically determine its rate limiting steps by measuring the resulting light production. The identification of rate-limiting steps then allows us to optimize the pathway. Furthermore, with these findings, an improved and experimentally validated mathematical model of the LUX pathway will be constructed. By strategically altering biosynthetic gene expression, we have gained a means to tailor the reporter/sensor to better suit our needs (i.e. make it brighter) and a generalizable method to rapidly optimize metabolic pathways.	breakliquid	Phillip Kyriakakis	None	None	tpcoleman	Todd Coleman	None	None	f2contre;wthavara;ljenn;tmt002;gunadhiv;rravindr	Fernando Contreras;Walter Thavarajah;Jenny Lee;Tiffany Tran;Vivienne Gunadhi;Roshni Ravindran	Jahir;Bart	Jahir Gutierrez;Bartlomiej Borek	BBa_K1842000	BBa_K1842999

Plasmids are typically maintained in cells by encoding enzymes that hydrolyze or otherwise detoxify antibiotics added to the medium. However, this process carries an inherent risk for spreading antibiotic resistance to native bacterial populations through lateral gene transfer.

We are also developing an integrated, microcontrolled thermocycler using common household components. Using nichrome wire and a motorized fan for air circulation, the programmable prototype is an inexpensive, versatile thermocycler or plate incubator.

With antibiotic resistance genes spreading among microbial communities, common antibiotics used to treat H. pylori induced gastric distresses are losing efficacy.  UMassD proposes to create an alternative. An enzyme released by H. pylori which cleaves urea and releases ammonia as a byproduct – creating a pH buffered microenvironment.  It has been shown in previous studies that various peptides can inhibit urease activity in vitro.  The aim of our project is to engineer E. coli with a plasmid encoding a positively regulated, pH sensitive promoter.  The low pH will initiate the transcription of an inhibitory peptide coupled with a twin-arginine translocase leader sequence.  As a result, the decreased production of ammonia should inhibit H. pylori’s buffering capacity, reducing its ability to persist within the stomach.

Coli	Copper is a major pollutant in a variety of freshwater ecosystems.  When copper is oxidized from Cu+ to Cu2+, it often produces a free radical known as a reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is capable of severely damaging biological molecules. E. coli have the ability to uptake copper, but after a certain threshold, the copper becomes toxic to the cell. Due to the toxicity of copper, E. coli quickly saturate and are unable to uptake more than a small amount of copper.    Our goal is to increase the efficiency of copper uptake in E. coli for the purpose of bioremediation in freshwater ecosystems. We engineered E. coli to express the yeast CUP1 gene in an attempt to increase copper tolerance. CUP1 encodes a metallothionein protein that binds 11 copper atoms, thereby preventing formation of the ROS. In addition, metallothionein detoxifies hydroxyl radicals with its cysteine groups.	sfreeland	Stephen Freeland	None	None	crw21228	Cynthia Wagner	None	None	samkeat1;Reiki;JoeSparenberg;muktajbain;TCoard;Lyca13;akuznet1;Johnjayman;pran94;wangel2;parimaj1;Mayliumbc	Samuel Keating;Ryan O'Connell;Joseph Sparenberg;Mukta Bain;Thomas Coard;Natithorn Bhusri;Alex Kuznetsov;John Jayman;Pranesh Navarathna;William Angel;Pari Majethia;May Li	None	None	BBa_K1811000	BBa_K1811999

Among others, Type 1 Diabetes is the result of a partial or complete lack of insulin production that leads to deregulation of glucose levels in blood. Current available solutions for this disorder are based on complicated and expensive devices of external use.  We propose the use of an innovative system based on the construction of a bacterial sensor capable to respond to glucose concentrations; secondly this sensor aims to induce the production of insulin according to glucose levels.

Is a big problem in developing countries and for over 70 years several attempts to create an effective vaccines have failed; the way to prevent  disease is to control vectors: Aedes aegypti. There are at least 4 different virus serotypes which prevalence shifts every year,  patients who suffered one particular serotype become immune for life, but getting another serotype, reaction is so severe that dengue becomes hemorrhagic and lethal most of the times.    We designed synthetic proteins aimed to produce immunological response against dengue. Using databases and for proteins, epitopes and 3D structures programs we found epitopes for L and T white cells. Then selected a protein and inserted on its chain these epitopes from all serotypes, and 4 proteins containing just one serotype.	carolinaunah	Carolina Alduvin	None	None	Osmanpm;juanok;rmedina65	Osman Padilla Meza;Juan Carlos Ortiz Kafati;Roger David Medina Giron	None	None	AliRubio;Diana.sabillon;ricardozavala;NIMS;MadeleineR.Osorio;sonanuro;davidmeza11;Diego21;JohanReyes;JDSifontes;eduin;anmo1995;juanjo21841;armandofavianromero	Ali Rubio Hernández;Diana Beatriz Calderón Sabillón;Ricardo Alberto Zavala Sierra;Leticia Nichole Maradiaga Sikaffy;Madeleine Rodríguez Osorio;Sobeida Nazaret Nuñez Rosa;David Eduardo Meza Flores;Diego Alfredo Ardón Betancourt;Johan David Reyes Chavez;Juan David Sifontes;eduin josue castellanos davila;Andrea Nicole Matamoros Ortega;Juan Jose Diaz;Armando Favian Romero Mendoza	None	None	BBa_K1588000	BBa_K1588999

We designed four novel glucose-sensitive promoters and tested their ability to drive expression of reporter chromoproteins at various glucose concentrations. In conjunction with existing glucose sensitive promoters from the Parts Registry, we used our novel promoters to design a biological device  that expresses different combinations of the three different chromoproteins in response to glucose in Escherichia coli. As such, this device can detect a larger dynamic range of concentrations of selected molecules (e.g., glucose). Our project aims to provide a cheaper alternative for diabetics than current, more expensive, glucose-monitoring systems. While driven by this initial problem, continuing work has shown that our approach may have its greatest potential as a more general molecular sensing platform, capable of being easily customized for the sensing of a broad range of relevant compounds.	smgomez	Shawn Gomez	None	None	lvtse;eborcha2	Victor Tse;Erin Borchardt	None	None	UNCFadden;jerryz;seanjc;ElliotKrause;wrchurch;kyungseo	Connor McFadden;Jerry Zhang;Sean Johnson;Elliot Krause;William Church;Danny Oh	baj2235	Bryan Johnson	BBa_K1838000	BBa_K1838999

Synthetic biology could help provide a solution by creating genetically modified organisms capable of producing essential compounds for Mars-colonist survival.     Our first step has been to make moss able to produce compounds essential for it to thrive on Mars.

However, this approach does not explain many complex and finely-tuned phenomena in the cell. We believe that a special genetic network, known as a “tri-stable switch,” can model cell differentiation. This network would allow a cell to “specialize” from a quasi-pluripotent state to one of two differentiated states. By repurposing native transcription factors, we can build such a switch in the organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or baker’s yeast. If this network can indeed achieve tri-stability, it may give us insight on the mechanisms of differentiation in stem cells, and bring us a step closer to construction synthetic stem cells in the lab.	mkaern	Mads Kaern	None	None	None	None	None	None	arthanzel;MarinaKdsk;aross;ashnapar;erinnguyen	Martin Hanzel;Marina Kidisyuk;Alex Ross;Ashna Parbhakar;Erin Nguyen	ianroney	Ian Roney	BBa_K1652000	BBa_K1652999

Our project aims to degrade PAHs in industrial waste. The current waste handling method for PAHs is simply to deposit them in landfills where they leak into environment. Our cells need to detect the PAHs for the degradation. But the molecules do not readily pass through the membrane. We solved this predicament by using one of the smaller PAHs as an indicator to degrade the heavier PAHs.  The degradation of this small PAH inside the cell relieves repression of genes under the control of the NahR/Psal promoter system. This causes a series of enzymes to get expressed and secreted outside the cell, oxidising and cleaving the ring structures of the carcinogenic compounds, making them available for downstream bio-degradation. To increase the degradation efficiency our system also produces rhamnolipids.	andevirt	Anders Virtanen	None	None	None	None	None	None	Kiira;Oskarwestlin;ceal6335;sangeethabupalan;LinneaWestberg;bgreijer;haer8191;joag9745;flindeberg;diazel;Emlp93;Konrad;Joelstriem;anna.bostrom;AdrianSilberman;LouiseGranlund;AnnieHerbertsson;Fluffybunnymike;barcode;Thomas.Andersson;kandidaten;dmitry.laso;angl;jullibulli	Kira Karlsson;Oskar Westlin;Cecilia Ålander;Sangeetha Bupalan;Linnea Westberg;Björn Greijer;Hanna Elisabeth Eriksson;Josefin Ågren;Fredrik Lindeberg;Dianna Zeleskov;Ebba Perman;Konrad Gras;Joel Striem;Anna Boström;Adrian Silberman;Louise Granlund;Annie Herbertsson;Mikael Andersson Schönn;Delyan Georgiev;Thomas Andersson;Adam Engberg;Dumitru Laso;Anastasios Glaros;Julia Lundgren	None	None	BBa_K1688000	BBa_K1688999

In NDM, there are two bacterial systems for measurement: ROSE, an engineered bacterial reporter system integrated with permeability modification, logic amplification circuit and quorum sensing, is able to adjust EGFP expression level, and NDM reads fluorescence intensity from ROSE to send results in high resolution. CACCI, chemotaxis and transmembrane protein-modified bacteria, are chemically covalently adhered to a polymer membrane. Deformation caused by CACCI motility can be recognized with optical interference and the interference pattern recognition program inside NDM will analyze the deformation, thus antibiotic situation in sample can be accurately told.

He proposed that these patterns could be created by the network of two chemicals which have different diffusion rates.   This mechanism has been investigated for a long time. However, it was not easy to   analyze patterns found on living systems because of its complexity and technical difficulty.  We therefore reconstructed a Turing system using two advantages of synthetic biology; controllability and biological directness. By letting whole E. coli cells, whose motility were controlled, communicate with each other, we designed a system that works more ideally than any previous researches.

For diabetics, complications resulting from PGSs are the leading cause of death. Of the 100 million U.S. hyperglycemic patients, twenty-six percent regulate spikes through self-administered insulin, which is costly or easily misdosed. To reduce the amplitude of PGSs, we designed a sugar-concentration-dependent microbial system that delays and reduces the absorption of glucose and fructose from the small intestine. To show proof of principle, we introduced two genetic devices into E.coli to polymerize glucose into glycogen, to polymerize fructose into levan, and to induce cell lysis to release the polymerized sugar into the gut, thus reducing the amplitude of the glycemic spike. This microbial system, as a one-dose-fits-all solution, dynamically adjusts to glycemic spikes of fluctuating amplitudes. This system is a safer alternative to dosage-dependent drug therapies to stabilize blood sugar levels.	k7koz	Keith G Kozminski	None	None	None	None	None	None	ssc5cb;rwy2ag;amyomega;dmr5bq;ss4gv;issacli1205;sbs6eh;NotLastToRegister;ljw4gg	Supraja Shivakumar Chittari;Rena Wang Yuan;Jingyuan Zhang;Dominic Michael Ritchey;Shiran Su;Zhuo Li;Sean Bertram Sequeira;Connor Jahelka;Liam Wolf	jpapin;Tucker	Jason Papin;Matthew Tucker	BBa_K1600000	BBa_K1600999

However, given the heavy environmental and economic costs of fertilizers, interest in biological nitrogen fixation has recently increased. One possible alternative to artificial fertilizers is to transfer the highly active Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 nitrogen-fixing (nif) cluster to plant chloroplasts. However, further characterization of the cluster is needed before that can be done. We attempted to determine the set of genes from the large Cyanothece nif cluster necessary for nitrogen fixation and inserted our selected genes into two plasmids. In order to further characterize our minimal cluster, we developed CRISPR/dCas9 knockdown plasmids and overexpression plasmids. Additionally, we studied a genome-scale model of nitrogen-fixing E. coli through flux balance analysis that will help us optimize cofactors necessary for nitrogen fixation. We identified potential genetic interventions and media modifications that could improve cell energy levels, growth, and production of fixed nitrogen.	tsmoonha	Tae Seok Moon	None	None	None	None	None	None	ayekedavid;bactkinson;cbourg;MichaelToomey;lmbebe;kathrynCz;jao5285	David Ayeke;Blake Actkinson;Charlotte Bourg;Mike Toomey;Laura Beebe;Kathryn Czekalski;Jessica O'Callaghan	cimmethun;wrhenson;caroline.focht;lyra11;jefflee;tmueller24	Cheryl Immethun;William R Henson;Caroline Focht;Andrea Balassy;Ying-Chiang Jeffrey Lee;Thomas Mueller	BBa_K1605000	BBa_K1605999

Our team is attempting to re-engineer CRISPR to make it more flexible and easier to use. We’re making it easy to test different sgRNA designs: restriction sites added to the sgRNA backbone allow 20 nucleotide target sequences to be swapped without excessive cloning.

Hence, the reason for exploring the use of synthetic biology for modifying Escherichia coli for microbial fuel cells.    Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is a dissmilatory metal reducing bacterium. One of the several electron transport chains found in Shewanella oneidensis is the Mtr pathway. This specific pathway is involved in the accepting of electrons which then carries a potential electrical charge.    By cloning this pathway into E.coli, the aim is to produce an efficient electric producing microbial fuel cell (MFC). The efficiency of the MFC is down to the biofilm which is formed when cells adhere to a surface and stick to each other.    Shewanella oneidensis is capable of transferring electrons through extensions known as nanowires.

This type of module is very important in biology systems, because it can function as a signal filter, a signal multiplier or a time-frequency domain signal convertor (like the Hodgkin-Huxley model in action potential generation). To achieve threshold detection, we set up a red light sensor to obtain input and a negative feedback circuit to generate pulse output with good intensity and modularity. In our case, along with the other two systems we built, the module is proved to have potential application in biological computer and homeostasis maintenance. The former aids in storing addressable binary data in living cells while the latter helps prevent dental caries (tooth decay) by controlling the population of Streptococcus mutans at a satisfactory level.	zxxie	Zhixiong Xie	None	None	None	None	None	None	LiboCao;yxue;jcwang;littleshower;sylvia1120;cicijun;BYY;lyn;a595130080;Accepted;Jack_Blake;xiaowenyi;phesido;zhengxuemeng;River;GM;xiangxiangpupupu;shenyiran;xiongfei_whu;Nil;lyj96;ryang;anyy;lxk;lsmale;skyz	Libo Cao;Yun Xue;Jingcheng Wang;Zhenyu Wu;shouya feng;Han Dong;Yuanyuan Bie;Lin Wu;Binbin Chen;Xinwei Luo;Jie Zhang;Wenyi Xiao;Yuwenbin Li;Xuemeng Zheng;Teng Li;Guoming Gao;Jin Xiang;YIRAN SHEN;Fei Xiong;Tianchen Mu;YuJie Liu;Rong Yang;Yunyun An;Xunkai Li;Sheng Li;Tian Li	sz000001;SHY	Zheng Sun;Haoyuan Sun	BBa_K1647000	BBa_K1647999

Therefore, it is possible to discriminate tumor cells from other tissue cells by detecting the low glucose concentration. Using liposome as a vector, we hope to design a drug expression system with the ability to respond to different glucose level. To achieve this, we combine the CRP activator, a regulatory protein activated by cAMP, with red fluorescent protein (RPF) as a reporter of expression level. Since glucose concentration is reversely related with cAMP level, a change of glucose level can influence the binding of CRP with target operon, thus altering the fluorescent intensity.

Phage therapy, the focus of WLC-Milwaukee, is a potential alternative to antibiotics. We sought bacteriophages specific to the gram negative protein tolC, an outer-membrane efflux pore protein. TolC is of interest due to its role in certain antibiotic resistances, as bacteria use it to pump antibiotics out. TolC homologs are found in a variety of gram negative bacteria, including those causing diarrheal diseases. We focused on expressing tolC found in pathogenic bacteria, such as Cholera and Salmonella, in E. coli. The transgenic strains of E. coli were used to search for bacteriophages specific human GI tract pathogens. Once bacteriophages are identified for this tolC receptor, we hope to combine this phage therapy with an antibiotic resisted via efflux. Bacteria which become resistant to the bacteriophage through gene downregulation or function-destroying mutation risk increased sensitivity to the antibiotic action.

AFPs have many applications from tissue preservation to food security and more, but recently a novel application has emerged: inhibiting biofilms. Biofilms are problematic in many settings including healthcare, manufacturing, and the environment. The use of AFPs as anti-biofilm factors is intriguing, however, only a single AFP has yet been shown to inhibit biofilms. We built a diverse library of AFPs and characterized both their antifreeze and biofilm-inhibiting properties in E. coli. Our results demonstrate novel biofilm-inhibiting properties for some AFPs and further characterize the freeze protection properties of many AFPs at low subzero temperatures. Our results will inform the design of novel synthetic AFPs optimized for use in E. coli, and provide a valuable new resource for the integration of AFPs into synthetic biology and biotechnology applications.	nfarny	Natalie Farny	None	None	jduffy	Joseph Duffy	None	None	kmdesanty;cllajeunesse;cjreames;jmmazza;dmmorgan;bobmaster75	Kayla DeSanty;Chloe LaJeunesse;Charlotte Reames;Julie Mazza;David Morgan;Edward Dring	None	None	BBa_K1809000	BBa_K1809999

As we know, global warming will lead to ice melting, sea level rise and land desertification. When sensing the raised temperature, marine bacteria will open RNA thermometer and release signal molecules to ‘erode’ costal and polar bacteria, gradually making them blue and showing the submersion of these regions. Meanwhile, when inland bacteria get warmed, they will turn yellow from green, showing the process of desertification.

The framework involves two components: (1) propagation and selection of cultures and (2) manipulation of cell genomes by MAGE and/or CRISPR. We identified design considerations for both components of the framework, and experimentally validated propagation and selection considerations using cyanobacterial strain Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 (a fast-growing cyanobacterium capable of lipid biofuel production) and Sinorhizobium tropici CIAT (a nitrogen-fixing rhizobium which forms root nodules in legume plants). We then developed a workflow for the design, construction, and testing of MAGE and CRISPR technologies in non-model prokaryotes. The insights we gained from validating the propagation component of our workflow will serve to improve the versatility and robustness of our framework and will inform the development of tools for genetic manipulation in other non-model organisms.

Our choice of bacteria  Nissle 1917,  a probiotic strain of Escherichia Coli, once inside the body will secrete a cancer tracing protein which recognizes and builds up around the cancer cells. Using the quorum sensing system, E.coli Nissle 1917 detects the bacteria inducing substance AI-2 produced by the tracing proteins. Nissle 1917 bacteria motion towards the region of AI-2 and once in the region, produce our cancer killing protein called apoptin.

The bacterium is found in warm water environments, particularly in artificial water supply systems such as air conditioning systems and cooling towers. The enfection occures by inhalation by small droplets of contaminated water. Our aim, as the team “Baskent_Meds”, is developing bacteria which can recognize Legionella pneumophila specifically at species level by legionella quorum sensing, and respond  by producing anti-Legionella peptide which is produced by some Staphylococcus strains. Quarum means “minimum”. Legionella pneumophila should sense the minimum amount of cells around to colonize in the environment and express its virulence. So our modified E. coli may sense the presence of Legionella pneumophila in any contaminated surface and kill it.	feridesahin	Prof.Dr. Feride I.

Blood typing is important because it can transfuse blood and identify individuals; in addition, changes in pattern of blood type antigen expression can even demonstrate malignancy. The current blood typing approaches mainly include slide agglutination, absorption-agglutination, PCR-RFLP and PCR-sequencing based method. In this project, we will use bacterial surface display method to display specific antibody (against type A or type B antigen) section (single-chain variable fragment, ScFv) onto the surface of the bacteria, thus expressing GFP or RFP. Bacteria producing ScFv and cells containing blood antigen will adhere to each other by incubation if the corresponding antigen exists on target cells, so we can characterize blood types and identify the intensity of the antigens on cell surface.	hanyang87	Xiaobin HAN	None	None	GuoQiangChen	GuoQiang Chen	None	None	AmyYang;eileen;Chuan;BrotherNextDoor;jebsenbjc;xiange88yang;yangtongyu;mary_ma;ssm018;Jianzhao;Channel96;zengjunchu;Yiou	Jie YANG;Eileen Zhou;Chuan YIN;WENQI WEI;Jiecheng BAO;Xian YANG;Tongyu YANG;Lilin Ma;Senmiao SUN;Jianzhao YANG;Chen XIE;Junchu ZENG;Yiou Wang	liteng07	Teng Li	BBa_K984000	BBa_K984999

Indigo is currently derived from petroleum using a high energy process, and commercial dyeing involves the use of reducing agents to solubilize the dye. The development of biosynthetic and bioprocessing methodologies for indigo dyeing could have environmental and economic advantages. By combining the biosynthesis of indigo and the use of the natural indigo precursor indican, we propose a more sustainable dyeing method as an alternative to chemically-reduced indigo in the large scale production of indigo textiles. We achieved in vivo indigo production in high titers, and efficient cleavage of indican using a non-native glucosidase. Inspired by natural systems, we isolated and characterized several plant and bacterial glucosyl transferases hypothesized to produce indican. Lastly, we compare the cost and environmental impact of our alternative with the present chemical process.	jdueber	John Dueber	None	None	zruss;tdj	Zachary Russ;Terry D.

After being released, these GMOs are no longer under direct control. As their effect on the environment is unknown, they pose a potential threat. In order to eliminate this threat, we are developing a genetic circuit, using e. coli as a model GMO, that limits the lifetime of a bacterial population after it is released to the environment. Our goal is to allow the end user to program a GMO population to survive in the environment until it has completed its task, after which the entire population will disappear without any further external intervention.  We employ two approaches to achieve this goal: One relies on the dilution of a synthetic control element through cell division, and the second is based on the lifetime of an essential protein containing an unnatural amino acid.

Therefore, we are developing a Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC). The goal of this project is to generate electricity with a modified Escherichia coli in a self-constructed fuel cell. Besides the technical optimization of the fuel cell, we investigate different genetic approaches like integrating porines and cytochromes as well as endogenous mediators. Using heterologous expression of pore-forming transmembrane proteins, we are able to enhance the extracellular electron transfer, leading to higher membrane permeability. Direct electron transfer can be achieved by integrating cytochromes into the cellular membrane, whereas a production of endogenous mediators enhances the electron transport to the electrode. With different aspects for technical and genetic optimization we enable Ecolectricity, the use of E. coli for direct energy production.	joernk	Joern Kalinowski	None	None	DocDexter	Christian Rueckert	None	None	ManuelS;nadiya;LukasR;sgrenz;Tore;Tomi;ThorbenM;FabianT;AnnaK;MatzeR	Manuel Schüler;Nadiya Romanova;Lukas Rositzka;Sebastian Grenz;Tore Bleckwehl;Tom Jonas Tubbesing;Thorben Meyer;Fabian Thomas;Anna Korszanska;Matthias Ruwe	TimoW;nluebke	Timo Wolf;Nils Luebke	BBa_K1172000	BBa_K1172999

The second protein will allow the bacteria to ferment sugars into ethanol. The sunlight driven energy will allow for more of the sugar to be used for ethanol fermentation than actual consumption so the output will be higher.

In a synthetic biological way, 2013 BIT iGEM assembled the T7 RNA polymerase gene and T7 promoter as an amplification block (amplifier), which is based on the high activity of T7 promoter to amplify the signal. To make the magnification controllable, a lacO operator regulated by lacI was assembled in downstream as a control block (controller), by adjusting the concentration of IPTG. With this block, several sensors of materials including but not limited to antibiotics are able to be enhanced controllable. This year, a sensor of beta-lactam newly designed and one of tetracycline are applied to detect the residual of antibiotics in milk which endangers human health. To make the detection faster and more convenient, milk samples and engineered E.coli are mixed in a tailor-made bio-chip and the green fluorescence will be detected and shown on a tailor-made electronic equipment.

To settle this problem, we constructed an Intelligent Microbial Heat Regulating Engine (I'MHeRE), which includes the customized thermo-tolerance system and the intelligent quorum regulating system, to help cells resist heat by regulating the expression of heat shock proteins and controlling the density of cells. The chassis host with I'MHeRE may make the fermentation less depend on the cooling system and shrink cost. Besides, cells could live well in higher temperature, because we extend their optimum living temperature and make them live in optimizing density.

Also, a self-regulating bacterial culture with intra consortial dependencies offers great advances in biosafety. To shut down the whole bacterial consortium, only on strain has to be eliminated.  We engineer three different E. coli strains to grow in a consortium exploiting different Quorum Sensing systems. Each strain maintains a constitutive expression of an inactive transcription activator (LuxR, LasR or RhlR). Inducers are synthesized by different synthases (LuxI, LasI or RhlI) that are each expressed in one strain and subsequently secreted into the medium. Once taken up by a cell, the inducers bind to the corresponding, inactive transcription factors to render them functional. As a result, an antibiotic resistance under the control of an inducible promoter is expressed.

The next-generation of strains could be “programmable,” with on demand generation of molecules within a bioreactor e.g. a yogurt fermentation capable of making any combination of flavouring, nutrients or pharmaceuticals. While merging all this potential into single hosts seems efficient, it would also bring added risk in the case of a process failure due to bacteriophage infection. Here, we not only rationally design widespread immunity to phage infection, but also hack this immunity system to yield programmable biosynthesis at the community level. We demonstrate this by building both broadly and specifically neutralizing CRISPR systems that were paired with biosynthetic capabilities for vanillin, caffeine and cinnamaldehyde production. Eventually, a fermentative process could exist  that is vaccinated to phage infection but susceptible to targeted phage addition that results in a programmable probiotic – or ultrabiotic.	joannealisonfox	Joanne Fox	None	None	shallam	Steven Hallam	None	None	NeginTousi;Fisal;michaeldapeters;joelkumlin;grace.yi;davevan;strachc;joeho604;liz.geum;xescape;TonyZhao;FrancesKR;AnnaMüller	Negin Tousi;Fisal Elstone;Michael Peters;Joel Kumlin;Grace Yi;David VanInsberghe;Cameron Strachan;Joe Ho;Liz Geum;Javi Zhang;Zheng Yu Zhao;Frances Russell;Anna Müller	JRound;mvanins;clawson	James Round;Michael VanInsberghe;Chris Lawson	BBa_K1129000	BBa_K1129999

Through industrialization we have become dependent on non-renewable fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment.  Recent research into renewable biofuels has included work on the production of corn-based ethanol and the microbial degradation of cellulose from terrestrial plants.  Biofuels derived from these sources are not fully sustainable.  Third generation biofuels include those derived from microalgae.  Cyanbacteria are microalgae known to fix carbon dioxide into alkanes through the collective processes of photosynthesis, glycolysis, and fatty acid biosynthesis.  The CAPS iGEM Team 2013 begins metabolic engineering of these pathways by expressing a rabbit muscle derived pyruvate kinase, known to be a key regulator of glycolysis, within the cyanobacteria Synechocystis PCC 6803 in an effort to increase alkane production.  Pathways will be modeled using TinkerCell and assays for the production of pyruvate, fatty acids, and alkanes will be used to characterize our system.	ekessler	Eric Kessler	None	None	jpwhalen;krtuel	Joseph Whalen;Kelley Tuel	None	None	dsgeick;capsamcclain;C.A.P.S.AAdams;MasonWilkinson;meaton2222;cnandresen;adjacobson	Dylan Geick;Amy McClain;Alec Adams;Mason Wilkinson;Muriel Eaton;Corinne Andresen;Austin Jacobson	afenton	Aron Fenton	BBa_K977000	BBa_K977999

Current research is focused on finding new ways to use bacteriophage either in their wild-type state or after they have been modified for use in synthetic biology.   We studied two ways to modify existing well-characterized bacteriophages. First, we employed random mutagenesis, CsCl purification, and plaque-size selection to isolate T4 and T7 bacteriophage with altered capsid sizes. A library of capsid sizes will allow researchers to select the appropriate bacteriophage for use in biotechnology or nanotechnology applications.  Second, we designed a cholera sensing and destruction circuit using bacteriophage lambda.  In this circuit, lambda contains biofilm-degrading enzymes controlled by a cholera quorum-sensing system transferred to E. coli.  Upon sensing cholera, this E. coli will activate lambda, leading to cell lysis and biofilm degradation. This research demonstrates the versatility and utility of bacteriophages in the field of synthetic biology.	jgrose	Julianne Grose	None	None	None	None	None	None	kiserk;kpeck;perry721;xiuqili;dlasko10;amberb6;Keltziee;mschellhous;clarlharr;arick6335;brymerr921;Sabinater09	Kendall Kiser;Kelton Peck;Lindsey Perry;Xiuqi Li;Darren Lasko;Amber Brown;Keltzie Smith;Michael Schellhous;Clarice Harrison;Arick Christopher;Bryan Merrill;Nathan Robert Sabin	dlk5	David L.

Whether in your water, salad or steak, pathogenic E. coli causes upwards of 250,000 illnesses every year. To solve this problem, iGEM Calgary is developing the FerriTALE to detect harmful E. coli. It uses engineered proteins that detect and report the presence of dangerous E. coli in a sample.  The detector, TALE, binds to genomic markers specific to dangerous E. coli. Next, our TALEs are attached to the scaffold and reporter, Ferritin, that rapidly alerts the user to the presence of E. coli through a visible color change. We have integrated these proteins into a handheld device, similar to a home pregnancy test, that tells the user if dangerous E. coli is present. Moving forward, the FerriTALE can be tailored to detect other pathogens as the basis of a powerful new detection platform.	nygren	Anders Nygren	None	None	iaingeorge;Lisa.O;rmmayall;himika9;myarcell	Iain George;Lisa Oberding;Robert Mayall;Himika Dastidar;Mayi Arcellana-Panlilio	None	None	ali.honarmand;Dwoppers;TRemondini;wangsutom@msn.com;rmoges;jaosgood;JustinSD;azzucoloto;wkeithvan;sharonfeng1;Rai	Ali Honarmand;Denny Y Hoang;Taylor Remondini;Su Wang;Ruth Moges;Julie Osgood;Justin S.

Alberta, Canada is faced with a specific challenge: the development of petroleum-related industries has led to large volumes of contaminated water, requiring extensive monitoring and remediation before the eventual release of this water back into the environment. Currently, methods of monitoring are either too slow, labour intensive, or inaccurately report on the toxicity of the sample. With increasing government regulation in the petroleum industry, the time for new technology is now. The 2013 Calgary Entrepreneurial team is advancing an electrochemical biosensor for petroleum-related toxins through our early venture: FREDsense. Using a unique sensing platform, our technology is faster, more quantitative, and capable of operating in environments where existing biosensors cannot. With collaborations in both industry and government, we are building better biosensors for the needs of the present, as well as the future.	lmgieg	Lisa Gieg	None	None	rmalach	Robert Malach	None	None	rpgguardian;rmmayall;iaingeorge;Lisa.O;MaggieRY;Emily_Hicks;pjwu	David Lloyd;Robert Mayall;Iain George;Lisa Oberding;Margaret Renaud-Young;Emily Hicks;Patrick Wu	None	None	BBa_K1236000	BBa_K1236999

An alternative to conventional antibiotics is phage therapy. However, many temperate phage also form prophage. Our approach to antibiotic resistance is to engineer a temperate phage, Lambda, with light-activated production of superoxide. The fluorescent protein KillerRed was cloned into a plasmid vector and lambda gt11 with the IPTG inducible lac promoter. Lysogens were isolated and these strains were characterized and compared to E. coli with KillerRed from high-copy plasmids. Light activation of KillerRed resulted in decreased cell numbers. In addition, we modeled our system at multiple scales, including populations of phage and bacteria, KillerRed gene expression, ROS production, and effects of light. Having two methods of killing, lysis and superoxide, decreases the probability of developing resistance and our system overcomes the prior limitations of using wild-type temperate phages.	natasa_mz	Natasa Miskov-Zivanov	None	None	ctelmer;bruchez	Cheryl Telmer;Marcel Bruchez	None	None	estarkwe;enpederson;kebates;bbeltzer;awnadig	Evan Starkweather;Eric Pederson;Kathleen Bates;Benjamin Beltzer;Andrew Nadig	None	None	BBa_K1184000	BBa_K1184999

Recently, it was reported that non-magnetotactic cells such as yeast can be magnetized to some extent. We set the goal to transform E. coli into those that are attracted by magnets. By magnetizing E. coli, the cell harvesting process will be much simpler and more economical than the conventional processes such as centrifugation and filtration. To this end, we are conducting three itemized projects. (1) modification of iron transportation network to import as much Fe ions as possible in E. coli, (2) sequestering/ storing iron into human ferritin, and (3) converting cytosolic space from reducing to oxidizing in order to elevate Fe(II)/ Fe(III) ratio within. Because all such manipulations significantly impact the physiology of the host cell, we are establishing the BioBrick platform that enables the temporal knockdown of multiple genes using recently control technology such as CRISPRi.

Synthetic expression of active LL-37 in vivo is challenging due to the cytotoxic effects it has in the host. To make a resistant host that can export LL-37 to the media we intend to overexpress the E.coli acrAB and tolC operons, which activate the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, a mechanism related with resistance to this and similar peptides by expulsion. To create a system in which E.coli expels LL-37 only in the presence of specific pathogenic bacteria, we use the LsrA promoter, which allows transcription in the presence of AI-2, a molecule produced by these bacteria to communicate via quorum-sensing. To avoid self-induction we designed an antisense RNA with specific secondary structure to inhibit the translation of LuxS, the enzyme responsible of the production of AI-2 in E.coli.	pablo	Pablo Padilla	None	None	vescobar	Viviana Escobar	None	None	Andresferrino;alonsawesome;alientometal;gabs;nataquinones;dheredia;CAHM	Andrés Ferriño Iriarte;Alonso Sandoval;Carlos Roberto Cruz Maldonado;Gabriela Santos Rodríguez;Natalia Quiñones Olvera;Diana Heredia;Carlos Andrés Hernández Martínez	gordeiros;larsmx	Ricardo Munguía Díaz;Mario Sánchez Domínguez	BBa_K1230000	BBa_K1230999

However, current detection methods for these disease-causing bacteria suffer from one or more of the following limitations: 1) requiring sample enrichment, 2) inability of low-level detection, 3) indiscrimination between viable and non-viable cells, 4) small sample volume capacity, 5) tedious procedures, and 6) high assay cost. Our Universal Self-Amplified (USA) Biosensor uses a genetically modified detection bacteria to solve many of the aforementioned issues. The engineered USA bacteria will recognize a target chemical produced by the pathogen of study, which will trigger a cascade of genes to both amplify the chemical signal and produce a visible alert to the pathogen’s presence. The USA pathogen detection mechanism strives for rapidity, economy, and simplicity.	tzuenrt	Tzuen-Rong Jeremy Tzeng	None	None	mcao	Min Cao	None	None	rkane;mbickfo;jrw5;awhatle;rlouie;ascanla;dakotaj;jtzeng	Ryan Kane;Matthew Bickford;Jennifer Wilson;Ariel Whatley;Rachel Louie;Aaron Scanlan;Dakota Glenn Jones;Jessica Tzeng	abrown;Maryam	Aaron Brown;Maryam Saffarian	BBa_K1090000	BBa_K1090999

Our project aims to improve the bioluminescence system of Escherichia coli in which bioluminescene protein from Vibrio fischeri is expressed. The 2010 Cambridge iGEM team increased the duration of bioluminescence by making H-NS mutant E. coli strains, derepressing the Lux gene repression. We engineered E. coli to overexpress phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck) to harbor a high intracellular ATP concentration and express proteorhodopsin to make ATP production possible when nutrients were limited. However, contrary to our prediction, the intensity and duration of bioluminescence in E. coli did not increase. After further literature search, though, we discovered that replenishing FMNH2 is crucial in maintaining bioluminescence. Therefore, to maintain a high redox pool, our team will utilize pathways that can increase redox pool or couple ATP concentration with NAD+ reduction in response to ATP formation.	igchoi	In Geol Choi	None	None	None	None	None	None	eugeniestar;ykm0820;justicestripe;MichaelDuke;pigmeng	Eugenie Choe;Gyeongmin Yoo;Sirwoo Kim;Joon Hyuck Moon;Myung Gun Seo	nana0120	Areum Goh	BBa_K992000	BBa_K992999

While fertilizer is a requirement for modern life, runoff from over-fertilized farmland can cause eutrophication.  In the presence of abundant ammonia, algae overgrow and consume much of the available oxygen in the water.  This results in decreased biodiversity throughout the watershed.  Within Europe, 53% of lakes are eutrophic.     Using two E. coli mutants built with genes from Nitrosomonas europaea and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we provide a system to reverse nitrogen fixation.  Our mutants consume ammonia and produce nitrous oxide, and release a sustainable source of energy when decomposed into nitrogen and oxygen.  We also provide a prototype of a bioreactor that could be scaled up and deployed in the field to simultaneously clean the water and produce energy.	cworkman	Christopher Workman	None	None	Roerdam;bfsmets	Mikael Rørdam Andersen;Barth F.

Bistable switches and oscillators, key building blocks of more complex gene networks, have been constructed using naturally occurring and well-characterized regulatory elements. In order to expand the versatility and variety of these circuits, we designed and constructed gene networks using artificial transcription factors (ATFs). The ATFs are of two classes: inhibitory TAL proteins and a catalytically inactive dCas9 protein with small guide RNA elements, each orthogonal to the yeast genome. Using mathematical modeling, we determined the parameters expected to create bistability and oscillation, using tandem binding site kinetics to achieve cooperativity. Based on these results, we assembled a library of plasmids containing ATFs, binding sites, regulatory elements, and fluorescent reporters. We then integrated these genes into the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and are currently characterizing them using flow cytometry.	cgersbach	Charles Gersbach	None	None	None	None	None	None	mattfarnitano;ashleyreid;RedSunX;mattbaron;hyunsoo_kim;cameronkim	Matthew Farnitano;Ashley Reid;Janan Zhu;Matthew Baron;Hyun Soo Kim;Cameron Kim	None	None	BBa_K1204000	BBa_K1204999

Using Bacillus subtilis as chassis, we are engineering organisms to capture ions using chelators and metal binding proteins, and to ferment organic components to produce biofuels. We are also testing a new assembly procedure, GenBrick, based on the Genabler assembly system. GenBrick allows assembly of multiple RFC10-compatible BioBricks in a single reaction, and is also well suited to the preparation of fusion proteins and addition of terminal tags. Enzyme fusions may enhance metabolic pathways through substrate channeling. We are testing the effect of protein fusions on fermentation efficiency for biofuel production. In addition, we are examining the implications of possible Scottish independence, following the 2014 referendum, for synthetic biology in Scotland.	cfrench	Chris French	None	None	jslikas;aelfick	Justinas Slikas;Alistair Elfick	None	None	krothschild;JanL;hristianita;GBlackhurst;HugoBoss;TheFlash;alewicka;hthornton;weike1013	Kyle Rothschild-Mancinelli;Jan Lyczakowski;Hristiana Pashkuleva;Gavin Blackhurst;Hugo Villanueva;Dainius Tautvaisas;Aleksandra Lewicka;Harry Thornton;Weike Xiao	dsradford;Lina_Gasiunaite;nait;Maryia Trubitsyna	David Radford;Lina Gasi;Maryia	BBa_K1122000	BBa_K1122999

The team’s vision is to build a biosynthetic drug delivery concept. The key word of this project is “adaptability”. Our goal is to explore a way of using E.Coli as a highly modular carrier, opening the gate to several applications and alternatives in disease treatments.   Using the principles of synthetic biology, we engineered a gelatinase secreting E. Coli able to bind gelatin nanoparticles using a biotin-streptavidin interaction and release them in a corresponding location. The drug delivery system is built in three parts: 1) the nanoparticle binding and 2) the environment sensing that 3) triggers the gelatinase release of the engineered E. Coli, liberating the content of the nanoparticle. The nanoparticles made of gelatin are able to carry any type of organic compound leading to a wide range of applications.	groovescience	Bart Deplancke	None	None	kristinawdrff;rp;Ekaterina	Kristina Woodruff;Rachana Pradhan;Ekaterina Petrova	None	None	leabernier;sophierivara;mareikeapelt;sandelisa90;Nadia7788;cbroenni;GigiGoesGugu;miarrigo;justafre;toone	Léa Bernier;Sophie Rivara;Mareike Apelt;Sandra Elisabeth Chaudron;Nadia Bérard;charlotte broennimann;Luisa Spisak;Marcelle Isaline Arrigo;Axelle Justafré;Caroline Desmurget	barbaragrisoni	Barbara Grisoni-Neupert	BBa_K1111000	BBa_K1111999

The goal is to clear an agar “minefield” without detonating mines. Genetically engineered Escherichia coli colonies are used as sender-cells (mines) and receiver-cells (non-mines). Mines secrete the signaling molecule N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (OHHL) whereas non-mines process the signal. To distinguish between OHHL-levels, a library of PLuxR promoters with various sensitivities was created through site-saturation mutagenesis. High-pass filters were constructed to control the expression of different orthogonal hydrolases in non-mines, depending on the number of surrounding mines. Additionally, the mines express their own hydrolase. A spatiotemporal reaction-diffusion model was established to evaluate and improve the system. To play Colisweeper, a colorless substrate solution is pipetted onto a colony of choice. The result is a defined color change within minutes, allowing identification of the played colony and the number of mines surrounding it.	sven	Sven Panke	None	None	kobibenenson;mjeschek;haeflibe;laurapr;angelicb;gmorgado	Yaakov Benenson;Markus Jeschek;Benjamin Häfliger;Laura Prochazka;Bartolomeo Angelici;Gaspar Morgado	None	None	arterm;niederbm;angela_a;Blockmoka;sposadac;olka;parvathi.m.chandran	Meret Arter;Matthias Niederberger;Angela Aeschbach;Fabian Wolter;Susana Posada Cespedes;Aleksandra Kalinowska;Parvathi Chandran	sabine.oesterle;luwidmer	Sabine Oesterle;Lukas Widmer	BBa_K1216000	BBa_K1216999

Many bacterial systems currently rely on external stimuli to induce transcription. One dimensional protocols often require constant monitoring of applied chemical concentrations, leading to them becoming inept for more complex systems.  A triplet of NOT gated photoreceptors in Escherichia coli, will be used to create a system which is finely controlled using only light. This will be showcased using magenta, cyan and yellow pigments as outputs. Varying the intensity and wavelength of light projected onto E. coli will control the shade and colour produced, respectively. Hence, this will show the versatility of the optical control by creating a full colour bio-camera. Additionally, using bacteria to produce an image vastly increases the resolution when compared to conventional cameras, due to the micrometre scale of bacteria.

The iGEM-Team Frankfurt 2013 searches for ways to transfer the pathway of the plant into Saccharomyces cerevisiae in order to make stevia production possible with both lower effort and lower costs. Several of known problems with carbohydratesweeteners like diabetes or caries could be overcome by the Steviolglycosides which are produced by Stevia rebaudiana.     We're building upon results gained from last year's competition which gave us the possibility to transfer a mevalonat plasmid into yeast to increase the production of a steviol-precursor Geranylgeranyl-diphosphate. This year we're searching for a further reconstruction of the pathway and transfering the 2nd plasmid for synthesis of Steviol from Geranylgeranyl-diphosphate into yeast. Thus the whole pathway can take place in a microbial organism and easify the production by lowering the costs.	e.boles	Eckhard Boles	None	None	None	None	None	None	SWiSH;SAP_BI_F;Charlotte;Alaster;Zerbst;Apo;Ines;Betzz;AnnaKatharina;MajaR;Susanne	Sebastian Roy;Sascha Planz;Charlotte Lorenz;Norman Seeliger;Jade Martins;Alfred Berghoff;Ines Hassad;Jan Schlegel;Anna Eller;Maja Rennig;Susanne Pitzius	Johnson;WagnerSC;phen	Johnson madrid;Wagner S.

Therefore, we engineered the recently discovered and highly promising CRISPR/Cas9 system. The regulation is based on the RNA-guided Cas9 protein, which allows targeting of specific DNA sequences.  Our toolkit comprises not only a standardized Cas9 protein, but also different effector domains for efficient gene activation or repression. We further engineered a modular RNA plasmid for easy implementation of RNA guide sequences. As an additional feature, we established an innovative screening method for assessing the functionality of our uniCAS fusion proteins.  Single genes and even whole genetic networks can be modified using our uniCAS toolkit. We think that our toolbox of standardized parts of the CRISPR/Cas9 system offers broad application in research fields such as tissue engineering, stem cell reprogramming and fundamental research.

A recently-discovered riboswitch ALeader updated our ideas by its delicate, 75nt-structure consisting of an aptamer, a recombination site, and even a bicistron motif. Inspired by this natural design, we proposed a series of novel strategies this summer, with dynamic rather than static perspectives. Guided by the theoretical study on functional multistable states and semi-static states of a riboswitch, and the kinetics involving impacts from other systems such as CRISPR, RNA polymerases, ribosomes, and degradation complex, the ALeader-based functional multi-phase and tricistron switches are designed. We also tried to regulate aptamer’s function by manipulating its working environment instead of itself, with SpinachALeader-based real-time monitors to avoid the signal distortion. Furthermore, to demonstrate the advantages of RNA biobricks, we constructed an antibiotic-detector with ALeader, optimized by a network with a RNA-OUT/IN translational regulatory system.	xmding74	Xiaoming Ding	None	None	Ruoyu;kazaf	Ruoyu Luo;Jun Wang	None	None	Fudan_cyw;Quta_qbbiotheo;lxykh;cheese7;luciewen;shizhenhu;Shuqidu;nzy;WillWay;nijiadong;cxhe;luomei	Yanwei Cai;Haotian Q.

The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry compiled a Priority List of toxic substances, on which Cadmium was seventh. We combined the Green Fluorescent Protein coding region with a Cadmium Sensitive Promoter to create our detector, which provides a simple and inexpensive test for the presence of Cadmium in water supplies. We will incorporate sensitivity tuners to decrease the detection threshold, and we will use mutagenic PCR on both the promoter and the entire detector to increase its sensitivity. Proper use of this BioBrick could result in early detection of cadmium polluted water and potentially prevent deaths worldwide.

Replicating the natural properties of MAPs through in vivo production using microbes is difficult as it depends on post-translational modifications, primarily the hydroxylation of tyrosine residues to L-DOPA. Since adhesiveness is correlated with L-DOPA content, our project aims to improve the adhesive properties of MAPs by utilizing a strain which inserts the non-canonical amino acid L-DOPA at UAG stop codons during translation. When combined with the in vivo production of free L-DOPA, this system is a significant step towards rapid, cost-effective MAPs production.

Once the input is sensed, the input promoter triggers hrpR's transcription. The activity of Ptet is constitutive, which means HrpS protein is ample. As HrpR accumulates, HrpS binds to HrpR and form HrpRS which then triggers PhrpL, and tetR and output begin to accumulate. tetR can inhibit Ptet. As a feedback, HrpS and HrpRS will decrease. PhrpL will be of lower activity, so the amount of tetR  and the level of output will decline. The decrease of tetR will enhance the hrpS' expression. All these construct a feedback cycle.

Their expression is cleverly controlled by promoters and RBSs. Precise regulation of recombinant genes is hard to achieve. Imbalance in regulation results in little production.  However, it is hard to objectively select promoters and RBSs. We thought that E. coli could do the selection for us. We created a kit for E. coli to find the best suited promoters and RBSs. It enables our lab E. coli to be like “Maestro” who creates excellent harmonies with lots of instruments.  For the kit we created an original promoter and RBS families with different strengths. We checked and made these parts to be reliable. And it only takes a single golden-gate assembly to get your construct!  We made the promoters and RBSs by selecting from randomized libraries. Using the kit, E. coli can choose optimal promoters and RBSs by her/it/him-self, just like the maestro.	yamazaki	Ken-ichi Yamazaki	None	None	None	None	None	None	kenta;trick;Naoya;umeuchi;TaKeZo;barao;Amigo;slecat;nousan;Osamu;sachikonitta;kwt;Ushi;kakurehana;Ahchan	Kenta Mine;Kensuke Yasuda;Matsumura Naoya;shiho umeuchi;Takeshi ITOH;Kusuko OBARA;Ami Kawahata;Ichiro Takeuchi;Ryotaro Nouda;Osamu Horiguchi;Sachiko Nitta;Shinya Kawata;Miho Ushida;Hana SHIMOYAMA;Ayano Hata	sprkata;laurynas	Kazuki Takahashi;Laurynas VANAGAS	BBa_K1084000	BBa_K1084999

Triggered by change in potential across the cell membrane, VS can separate or bring targeting enzymes into proximity, thus allowing an instant control of enzymatic reaction. We also utilized VS to accelerate the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) degradation system – another highlight of our project. The metabolites of certain PAHs are mutagenic and carcinogenic. We codon-optimized laccase from Bacillus sp. HR03 and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 for Escherichia coli, which when forming a cascade, PAH degradation into less toxic simple carboxylic acid would occur. Since quinones are intermediates in the degradation of PAHs, we also added quinone sensing and response repressor (QsrR) to control the degradation process.

In a synthetic biology approach, we are working to create an artificial futile cycle in mammalian cell by introducing glyoxylate enzymes native to bacteria. Past research has shown that mice expressing enzymes constituting an active glyoxylate shunt are shown to be resistant to diet-induced obesity. Our team plans to introduce an inducible system that allows us to couple the sensing of circulating fatty acid concentrations with an inducible circuit of glyoxylate shunt. Our inducible system is intended to prevent the risk of fatty acid deficiency, while facilitating greater fatty acid uptake at higher fatty acid circulating concentrations. Such a system should increase the feasibility of a glyoxylate cycle engineered to function in vivo.	kinglchow	King L. Chow	None	None	bocemun	Jessica C.M.

However, this comes along with heavy financial burden to developing or underdeveloped countries. In addition, almost all these drugs have side effects to liver and renal.    Here is a novel method to treat Hypertension by constructing human-friendly engineering bacteria that can produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) periodically and naturally to help maintain the blood pressure in safe level.    SCFA, especially acetate and propionate, has been proved to induce vasodilatation and ensuing hypotensive response via receptors in smooth muscle cells of vessels. This year we have found a metabolic pathway in Escherichia coli that converts succinate to propionate through Wood-Werkman reaction. An operon consisting four genes encodes enzymes in this pathway. By combining bio-oscillator and key gene together, we want to make E. Coli release propionate periodically in patients’ intestine periodically.

Currently, there is no treatment for Shiga toxicosis and it leads to complications in the human system like hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and renal failure. Here, we propose a two-fold, novel synthetic biology approach to combat the lethal effect of the toxin. We aim to neutralize the already produced toxin through a nine amino acid Gb3 mimic peptide. We have engineered the Gb3 mimic along with a cellular export signal (ompF) downstream of AHL(quorum sensing molecule) inducible promoter (pLuxR). We also plan to prevent further toxin production by inhibiting the biofilm formation of shigatoxigenic E.coli using indole-3-acetaldehyde (I3A). We expect to validate our approach through functional assays and in silico modelling. Our findings can potentially initiate a new perspective of tackling Shiga toxicosis using synthetic biology tools.	nrm	Nitish R Mahapatra	None	None	None	None	None	None	nandita94;MSM!TANS4;mayanknkc;Nishitam;rohanbendre;Tolkappiyan;kanishkatks;namitholay;Aman25;JunaidBabu	Nandita Damaraju;Mitan Sutradhar;Mayank NK Choudhary;Nishita Mohan;Rohan Bendre;Tolkappiyan Premkumar;Kanishka Purushottam Waghmare;Namit Holay;Aman Kumar;Junaid Babu	None	None	BBa_K1194000	BBa_K1194999

Over the next 50 years, the global community will produce approximately 2 trillion tonnes of waste, or 2.5 times the weight of Mount Everest. Traditionally, mixed non-recyclable waste is sent to landfill or for incineration, both of which result in environmental damage. The detrimental effects are perpetrated by the plastic degradation into toxic byproducts and the production of greenhouse gases by these processes. As an alternative we propose to upcycle this mixed waste into the bioplastic poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (P3HB) to create a closed loop recycling system. Our engineered E. coli will operate within sealed bioreactors. In the future we picture the use of our system in a variety of contexts as part of our M.A.P.L.E.

Aflatoxin contamination of foods that are found in many developing countries may cause a serious problem for human health.  ITB_Indonesia team for iGEM 2013 focuses on designing a whole cell biosensor for aflatoxin B1 detection in foods. The biosensor uses Escherichia coli as the chassis to build a genetic circuit using SOS response system to detect DNA damage caused by aflatoxin B1-oxide attack.  The SOS response promoter is followed by a reporter gene coding a chromoprotein, therefore the concentration of aflatoxin B1 in food samples could be easily detected by the color change of the bacteria.  For the ease of usage, we will design a syringe shaped device with our whole cell biosensor in it.

Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from existing vessels, is essential for tissue repair and can increase oxygen delivery to wounds, enhancing growth and recovery. Production of growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) can be elevated to promote angiogenesis in possible chronic wounds. To address inadequate oxygen during wound healing, we coupled the VHb promoter to a downstream gene encoding FGF. The VHb promoter is activated at an oxygen threshold below 2%, inducing transcription of the FGF gene in response to hypoxic conditions. We also tested the production of KGF under the influence of various constitutive promoters. This oxygen-sensing device is an addition to the growing treatments targeted towards angiogenesis promotion to improve healing in patients with severe wounds.	msburnett@fcps.edu	Mary Susan Burnett	None	None	None	None	None	None	jaeroid;tinaju;manotric;Sahitya;2014ebo;2014wwoodruf;arjun.iyer222;Ace354;LK11235;Nihita;2014ywang;daniel.carris	Ji Sung Seo;Tina Ju;Manotri Chaubal;Sahitya Allam;Eric Bo;William Woodruff;Arjun Iyer;Peyton Randolph;Lucas Kang;Nihita Manem;Yuchen Wang;Daniel Carris	None	None	BBa_K989000	BBa_K989999

The magnitude of loss is difficult to quantify as it changes with aphid species, crop species, location, year and other factors. The use of insecticides to control aphid population is contested, as it has a negative effect on the natural predators and aphids grow resistant.

Micro-Beagle is a modular system, utilising Ice Nucleation Protein to express and position target-binding peptides on the cell surface. Target binding induces membrane stress that activates the Cpx signalling pathway, and Micro-Beagle thus utilises a promoter from this pathway (pCpxR) to initiate expression of a reporter protein, such as GFP. As a proof of concept, we have used silica beads as a model diagnostic target (a pathogen surrogate) and the silica-binding “Si4” sequence as the target-binding peptide. We foresee Micro-Beagle being adapted for both the detection of waterborne pathogens and a variety of other diagnostic applications, and we envision future multisensor Micro-Beagles in which diverse pathogens can be simultaneously and quantitatively measured from a single water sample.	bmb6mjm	Michael McPherson	None	None	Chmlba;SDeacon;alexoneill;SteveEvans	Lukmaan Bawazer;Sarah Elizabeth Deacon;Alex O'Neill;Stephen Evans	None	None	SKnight;jeni;joebeton;ciccone;okarpov;danielburt;emilyjtay;Parsley	Sabrina Knight;Jennifer Shoesmith;Joseph Beton;Jonah Ciccone;Oleg Karpov;Daniel Burt;Emily Taylor;Paul Turner	rbavage1;bsjfr	Rose Bavage;James F.

However, increased complexity often requires more genetic material that can be difficult to introduce into organisms. We propose the development of a new library of regulatory gene expression elements that allow for compression of multiple coding sequences into a smaller amount of genetic space. Using a pseudoknot RNA structural motif, commonly used by viruses to minimize their genome size, we will show the utility of dual-coding gene sequences to give useful protein products whose expression can be regulated by the pseudoknot’s ability to induce ribosomal frameshifting. A software tool will also be used to overlap multiple coding sequences into different reading frames. Ultimately, this library of standardized parts will be available for use in a variety of engineered systems requiring minimal coding space and multiple protein expression.

A Synthetic Biology Approach to the Production of Natural Oxytocin	"This project revolves around the production of the hormone oxytocin within a bacterial cell. Due to the short half-life of the hormone, it is difficult to study and expensive to store and transport. The ultimate goal is to allow for oxytocin to be produced quickly, efficiently, and inexpensively to allow healthcare professionals and researchers access to a hormone that is not yet well understood. To accomplish this we will be constructing two separate systems: one to produce the Oxytocin-Neurophysin compound, and the other to produce NEC1, a cleavage enzyme responsible for detaching oxytocin from it’s carrier molecule which stabilizes oxytocin. The second system will be optimized to produce NEC1 at a rate that will allow maximal efficiency between production and cleavage. Upon completion, we intend to thoroughly characterize our parts and then submit them to the registry. Our human practices component is rooted in public education about synthetic biology."""

Antibodies are usefull for recognition of antigens in food. Antibodies have, however, a very complex structure that is not suitable for expression in E. Coli. The Camelid antibody IgG (cIgG), however, has lower complexity than the Human IgG. We present a new approach for recognition of food allergens with a synthetizised cIgG for expression in E. Coli. The epitope of cIgG is designed for Hen Egg White Lysosyme (HEWL). The cIgG is designed with a linker that connects to the bioluminescent enzyme Luciferase. We also synthetizised an HEWL antigen carrying the protein RFP, A-HRFP, that reacts to the luminescence of luciferase as the A-HRFP attaches to the cIgG.      The recognition of HEWL in a sample leads to the release of luminescent green-light as a result of HEWL binding to the cIgG. If, however, no HEWL antigen is present in the sample, A-HRFP binds to cIgG resulting in a luminescent red-shift.	robertfo	Robert Forchheimer	None	None	david.jullesson;asawa	David Bergenholm;Åsa Wallin	None	None	philipblomstorm;jessikahellstrom;magnusrefthammar;RichardK;linneamellberg;aoborg;Patello;matilda.eriksson;david.hallberg	philip blomstrom;Jessika Hellström;Magnus Refthammar;Richard Kullberg;Linnéa Mellberg;Anna Olofsdotter Borg;Patrik Ekenberg;Matilda Eriksson;David Hallberg	None	None	BBa_K1083000	BBa_K1083999

Chlorophyll is a green pigment that facilitates this energy production in photosynthetic organisms. Although the biosynthesis pathway for chlorophyll has been thoroughly investigated, the reproduction of this pathway in a non-photosynthetic organism has, to date, not been achieved. Successful production of chlorophyll in a bacterial host is the first step towards the synthetic construction of photosystem II, and the eventual creation of a renewable energy source. Our research involves expression of twelve genes (from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) necessary for the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway in a bacterial host (E. coli). Gene sequences have been synthetically designed to allow for prokaryotic expression. By utilising Gibson assembly, we plan on being able to successfully produce chlorophyll in prokaryotic cells. This will be evident from the growth of green E. coli colonies.	lbrown	Louise Brown	None	None	rwillows;npacker	Robert Willows;Nicki Packer	None	None	DominicLogel;mikeee;Trouch;Scott91;Brownie;Kirsten;Katherine;sciencelad83;Annika_J;ranisharma;Nadine83;AmyLRyan;Amirsync;DanJRussell;#yolo;dubiparipovic;JarradPhillips;DMC;ChrisSteel;Avneeta;Fatimamq;AdamHammonds	Dominic Logel;Michael Gibbs;Mark Trouch;Scott Chan;Ben Brown;Kirsten Gadsby;Katherine Blackshaw;Harrison Campbell;Annika Van Lierop;Rijata Sharma;Nadine Dissanayake;Amy Ryan;Abdul Mir;Daniel Russell;Ethan Cooper;Diana Ubiparipovic;Jarrad Phillips;Damien McCarthy;Chris Steel;Avneeta Mala;Fatima Habl almatin;Adam Hammonds	Jo;dr.biohacker;elleworgan;ELDaniel;Silas	Joanna Hare;Yagiz Alp Aksoy;Ellen Worgan;Elizabeth Daniel;Silas Vick	BBa_K1080000	BBa_K1080999

Many pharmaceutically relevant proteins, such as antibodies, have a complex biological structure with specific posttranslational modifications. Furthermore, these proteins need to be highly pure because of their use in diagnostics and treatment. Therefore, a major challenge is the development of systems that produce pure, posttranslational modified proteins - best at low costs.     Recently, the sunlight-driven microalgae Phaeodactylum tricornutum has been established as an elegant tool for the production of proteins. A major - however yet unchallenged - advantage of this system is the production of advanced proteins with specific posttranslational modifications and the ability of their direct secretion into the medium allowing easy purification with low effort and costs. Our mission is to challenge Phaectory for the convenient production of antibodies and make the system accessible to following iGEM teams.	bongsch	Dr. Gert Bange	None	None	Boelker	Michael Bölker	None	None	P.Pausch;Peterpankacake;GreveeBoy;ChristianM;lucas_;RomanM89;Friessan;Kuehnma;Gwendolyn;Rosskopf;Domenica;AnnePia;WiebkeD;DominikB;Krissy;Mucino;FKemter;MathiasDiehl;SimonD	Patrick Pausch;Florian Drescher;Alexander Grevel;Christian Muchowski;Lucas Schneider;Roman Martin;Sandra Fries;Marco Kühn;Gwendolyn Patzer;Sabine Rosskopf;Domenica Martorana;Anne Pia Lutz;Wiebke Dürichen;Dominik Beuter;Kristina Rau;Estefanía Muciño Castillo;Franziska Kemter;Mathias Diehl;Simon Dersch	Enantiomere	Daniel Kleinsorge	BBa_K1071000	BBa_K1071999

However, the only systems studied so far are not completely unidirectonal in their ability to flip a segment of DNA. Instead, previous systems have relied on “recombination directionality factors”, which when complexed with the unidirectional recombinase, reverse the direction in which it flips the DNA segment. The fim system from E. coli, has been shown to contain 2 unidirectional recombinases, hbif and fime, which flip a promoter containing segment of DNA. Our project seeks to engineer the fim switch by replacing the native promoter with another promoter. We demonstrate that it can function as a reliable and efficient biological transistor, or “transcriptor”. Beyond storing information and performing basic computations, the system would serve as a very useful, tightly controlled switch.	mcammer	Marc Ammerlaan	None	None	None	None	None	None	MikeFerguson;namunsri;evolver;Sspangl;ekirk;dtdunham;jonahps;jheis;klminch;Raoul.O.Martin	Mike Ferguson;Namun Srivastava;Joshua Abramson;Scott Spangler;Kirk Elliott;Drew Dunham;Jonah Sementkowski;Jon Heiselman;Kaitlyn Minchella;Raoul Martin	None	None	BBa_K1077000	BBa_K1077999

To address this, we have constructed pMNBB, a versatile shuttle vector system. pMNBB vectors provide researchers a modular BioBrick platform to introduce synthetic pathways into E. coli and also the option to rapidly transfer these constructs into P. pastoris. Not only is this vector system designed for integration of expression cassettes into the P. pastoris genome, but we have also added elements which allow for the episomal maintenance of these plasmids. Moreover, these vectors are amenable to trans-kingdom conjugation (TKC).  Rather than following a yeast transformation protocol that can take days to weeks, our constructs may be introduced to a yeast culture in roughly one hour. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we use the pMNBB vector system to produce and secrete active human insulin from P. pastoris.	schmi232	Claudia Schmidt-Dannert	None	None	bloch029;GraysonW;heldm;jimmyellinger;KaneA;jparejko	Sarah Bloch;Grayson T Wawrzyn;Mark Held;James Ellinger;Aunica Kane;Jim Parejko	None	None	heins049;Berg10;jennifer.strommen;hsuxx166;lemie033;tarnowki.jm;Basem;tenol004	Stephen C.

Coordinating behavior across cell populations to form synthetic tissues requires spacial communication between individual cells. While there has been some success engineering single signals, sending multiple signaling elements spanning spatial scales for multicellular coordination remains a significant hurdle. Here, we describe a method for mammalian cell-cell communication utilizing engineered exosomes containing miRNA or protein signals. First, we demonstrate selectively packaging signaling miRNAs (miR-451 and miR-503) and synthetic fusion proteins (GFP, Cas9, and Cre recombinase each individually fused to the oligomerizing membrane targeting domain Acyl-TyA) into exosomes within cells engineered with sender genetic circuits. Next, we demonstrate that these miRNA and protein signals can modulate gene expression within cells engineered with receiver genetic circuits. Finally, we present preliminary cell-cell signaling results on populations of cocultured sender and receiver cells. Our method may enable multiplexed communication among populations of various cell types and the creation of sophisticated synthetic tissues.	rweiss	Ron Weiss	None	None	None	None	None	None	haox;azurita;lsaint;klathem;mpaturu;mklimak;nhall;bnadres;clescott;johnchow	Hao Xing;Aina Martinez Zurita;Lauren St. Hilaire;Kyle Lathem;Mounica Paturu;Molly Klimak;Nelson Hall;Brandon Nadres;Chamille Lescott;John Wei Chow	jbabb;dmishra;teague;eerik;jgam;f.menolascina;samirakiani	Jonathan W Babb;Deepak Mishra;Brian Teague;Kristjan Eerik Kaseniit;Jeremy Gam;Filippo Menolascina;Samira Kiani	BBa_K1179000	BBa_K1179999

Current methods are costly, which is a major deterrent for research on these applications. We have designed a system consisting of three strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli) which will convert spent grain waste from breweries into Eucalyptol. The design utilizes two strains of E. coli overexpressing and secreting enzymes to degrade hemicellulose into xylose. The third strain of E. coli will utilize the xylose and convert the molecule into Eucalyptol using the Mevalonate pathway. A scale-up model was developed to assess industrial feasibility.

It causes metabolic disorders in both animals and humankind.  Our team utilized the ribosome switch induced by atrazine, a QS system of Plux and a degrading enzyme to control E.coil’s motility through regulating it’s CheZ gene. Therefore, E.coli can recognize atrazine, recruit team workers, and degrade atrazine.   Our team found a transporter of atrazine, which we call TRM. We also mutated the degrading enzyme, TrzN, making it better at degradation. We combined TRM and the TrzN to improve atrazine absorbance and degradation. Moreover, our team are trying to analyze and compare several systems with computer, hoping to find the best one which is equipped with faster moving and quicker degrading.  Overall,we believe our system will boost the industrialization, universalization as well as standardization in the field of treatment for atrazine and other versatile small molecules.	lwzvince	WENZHI LAN	None	None	wangbin;wjzheng	BIN WANG;WEIJUAN ZHENG	None	None	Lbaishe0309;Ultramagnuslvkun;HughPu;Hebe;FrankGreen;GaoJian_NJU;Nidhogg;WLQS;Goddy;Dusk;immzz;OwenLee;Jessica123;squid	YAFEI MAO;KUN LV;RUOKUN PU;YUANYUAN WANG;JUYAN ZHANG;JIAN GAO;JIANCHEN YANG;Yezheng Li;ZHAO XU;Zhipeng Cao;Zeng Mingzhi;YangYang Li;Jiajia Gao;SHUKE XIAO	None	None	BBa_K1145000	BBa_K1145999

Positive results in biosensors lead to the output of a reporter, commonly in the form of fluorescent proteins. Here we construct a biosensor that is capable of indicating the presence of various pollutants in water through expression of several different fluorescent proteins. We selected lead, copper, phosphate, and nitrate/nitrite promoters and paired them with specific reporter coding sequences. Presence of these ions drives the transcription of specific fluorescent proteins. Detection of these proteins is enabled through a light detection apparatus and the information can be sent to mobile devices in a user-friendly interface via a modified Google ADK. This novel multibiosensor can be implemented to detect pollutants in sewer systems, septic tanks, and other sources of water, and provide an early-detection warning system, preventing the pollutants from causing serious harm to equipment, animals, or people.	halpin	myra halpin	None	None	None	None	None	None	Morgan.Howell;Jack_Allen;mfinnegan;Danny.Oh	Morgan J.

The use of endolysins to fight bacterial plant disease is an emerging field, but it has largely been limited to gram-positive bacteria, as the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria prevents endolysins from accessing the peptidoglycan. Recombinant E. coli have been created to express endolysins which target various plant pathogens. These proteins can be used as a novel gram-negative bactericide when coupled with a treatment to disrupt the outer membrane. A system to easily detect outer membrane disruption will be critical to our project, as well as any future studies on gram-negative endolysins.  To address this, a registered iGEM part used for cell surface detection was improved and incorporated into a fluorescence-based assay. Erwinia amylovora, a gram-negative bacterium responsible for fire blight in fruit trees, was chosen as a model target for proof of concept.	cjhoward	Christie Howard	None	None	leochong718	Chong Tang	None	None	rghusn;csy;dordonez;jjiang;CSarcinella;htoups;behdad	Rebecca Ghusn;Christian Allen Sy;Dafne Ordonez;Simin Jiang;Cody Alexander Sarcinella;Haley Toups;Behdad Atarzadeh	None	None	BBa_K1136000	BBa_K1136999

The lack of a cell wall imparts a range of interesting properties and we show that L-forms can be used as a novel chassis for a range of fundamental applications in synthetic biology.     We produced a BioBrick for Bacillus subtilis, that allows cell morphology to be toggled from normal to L-form.  We have explored some of the interesting opportunities that L-forms provide including cell fusion, genome shuffling and the generation of differently shaped cells using microfluidics. L-forms are thought to exist naturally within plant tissues and we also studied their use as agents for delivering novel functionality into plants. For project outreach, we created a game as an Android application and considered the implications raised by our project and also look at the exciting relationship between synthetic biology and architecture.	naw3	Anil Wipat	None	None	njsh2;pzuliani;stachopeter	Jennifer Hallinan;Paolo Zuliani;Jem Stach	None	None	Justas;YDemyanenko;VLeonardo;GPettitt;MLaw;viwong;CEWall;RMcK;Denington;atamciuc;Izzy	Justas Miknys;Yana Demyanenko;Vincent Leonardo;Geoffrey Pettitt;Matthew Law;Vivian Wong;Chris Wall;Robert McKiernan;James King;Alina Tamciuc;Isabelle McLaren	o_gilfellon;PhilipHall;matthew.pocock;sungshic;ljw;MartynDR;SarahS	Owen Gilfellon;Philip Hall;Matthew Pocock;Sungshic Park;Ling Juan Wu;Martyn Dade-Robertson;Sarah Shapiro	BBa_K1185000	BBa_K1185999

It is a system which is permanently  tried to improve and mostly required for the purpose of enhancing a signal or for activating chain reaction pathways.   Our goal is to develop an alternative way of signal transfer instead of the classic manner by using chemicals like the quorum sensing molecule Acyl Homoserine Lactone (AHL) or several inducible promoters. Within our project, we will analyze the potential of a single bacterium to affect another bacterium or colony solely by the products of simple biochemical pathways like light or color and finally the effectiveness of the whole system.  Regarding the importance of safety procedures, we will test the ability of a colony to induce the death of another colony by ‘’photo-communication’’ and the effects on developing a secondary resistance beside the backbone resistance against contamination cases.

However, site-specific delivery has always been a challenge in gene therapy. Microvesicles (MVs) are lipid-bilayer vesicles which are naturally secreted by almost all cell types, playing crucial roles in intercellular transport of bioactive molecules. Given the intrinsic ability to naturally transport functional RNAs between cells, MVs potentially represent a novel and exciting drug carrier. In our project we are trying to express both anti-virus siRNA within the cell and target protein on the surface of the MVs by engineering the HEK 293T cell, which is capable of producing large amounts of MVs. Thus, the MVs produced by our engineered HEK 293T cells will contain the siRNA and be able to specifically deliver the siRNA to the sites we want, acting as biomissile for the targeted destruction of the disease.

Due to the time constraint, the scope of the project is limited to a dual-state promoter where an acid-responsive promoter is placed upstream of a constitutive promoter.  This novel transcription regulation element will have both constitutive and inducible activity. The construct will be tested by linking green fluorescent protein to the downstream promoter. Based on preliminary results, the extra promoter should allow for a significant increase in gene expression. These pieces have wide implications in any fields that require a quick upregulation of any gene in response to acidic environments.

The efficiency of traditional detection and diagnostic approaches is impeded by the time-consuming laboratory procedures, yet many of which grow poorly in bacterial cultures. All these limitations call for a new rapid and direct bacterial identification method to improve patient management and antimicrobial therapy.  Quorum sensing is a type of bacterial cell-cell communication correlates with the population size. Many bacteria have one or several species-specific quorum sensing molecules released in different growth state and environment. Quorum sensing signals are shown to be involved in many physiological functions, including virulence, biofilm formation and drug-resistance.

These compounds are extraordinarily stable, not readily biodegradable and have accumulated in the environment. PCBs also accumulate in animal fatty tissues including human tissues. As PCBs are probably carcinogenic and some are endocrine disruptors, they constitute an important health issue.   Although PCBs have no natural equivalents, some bacterial communities have developed the capacity to degrade PCBs. Highly chlorinated PCBs undergo anaerobic reductive dechlorination, lowering the chlorine atom number. Lightly chlorinated PCBs are then degraded via the aerobic biphenyl degradation pathway.

Noting the abundant genomic data of prokaryotes from aromatics-rich environment, Peking iGEM applied part mining to the genetic repertoire to develop a comprehensive set of biosensors for aromatics. The transcriptional regulators for each typical class of aromatic compounds were bioinformatically determined and promoter engineering and protein engineering were performed to tune their function.    To expand the detection range, enzymes in upper pathways, working as plug-ins, were coupled with biosensors to degrade aromatics to detectable compounds. For environmental detection, we construct the band pass filter to detect a certain range of concentration. Responses of biosensors equipped with band-pass filter can robustly reflect the concentration of environmental samples.     Peking iGEM has remarkably enriched the library of biosensors for aromatics and enabled quantitative detection for environmental monitoring. These biosensors will be also potent for metabolic engineering and well-characterized synthetic biological tools.	qiPku	Qi Ouyang	None	None	Robinbin	Shuobing Chen	None	None	Sophielothia;Sclereid;happydeer;Flora2013;Psyche;XingjiePan;belova;Franklin;hlviets	Wang Huan;Zheng Pu;Can Cui;Hailing Shi;He Shuaixin;Xingjie Pan;Liang Jing;Shiyu Liu;Helena Viets	Spring_zhq	Haoqian Zhang	BBa_K1031000	BBa_K1031999

Targeted methyltransferases are enzymes that catalyze sequence-specific methylation – the most useful tool for engineering the epigenome.  With a synthetic biology approach, we developed an assay to test targeted methyltransferases without expensive, time-consuming traditional methods. Our modular single-plasmid system allows methyltransferases to be easily cloned and tested via inexpensive digestion assays, quickly measuring the existence and extent of targeted methylation. Additionally, our plasmid contains standardized primer-binding sites for methylation-sensitive sequencing, and our E. coli chassis effectively eliminated noise associated with methylation studies. We are using this assay to characterize our novel targeted methyltransferases, which could be used to study epigenetic modifications. In the future, synthetic biologists could embrace these tools to explore the next frontier in engineering biological systems: the epigenome.	UPenn_Adviser	Brian Y.

Through synthetic biology, we are able to control the expression of genes that regulate the production of desired secondary metabolites. Via the manipulation of established metabolic pathways, we hope to produce vanillin and butanol. The prospect of being able to synthetically produce a biofuel provides vast possibilities for the scope of synthetic biology and green energy. Additionally through the manipulation of the cellulose synthase genes, we hope to increase the biomass of plants by a hybrid plant cell wall. As shown through these projects, the use of plants provides various green energy possibilities. However, due to the limited use of plants within synthetic biology there are various regulation issues. Thus we have additionally worked on characterizing a range of plant promoters as well as introducing the Cas9 crisper system into plants.	trichard	Tom Richard	None	None	jlp560;MarkGPSU;twmccart;nikkikapp;cta3	Jyotsna Lavanya Pandey;Mark Guiltinan;Thomas McCarthy;Nikki Kapp;Charles Anderson	None	None	ljberg;Sgt_Bisendi;Carbonell19;ceh5255;sam.ewell;DMS;Lah5415;pcygan7;sle5126;MichaelPSU	Lars Berg;Kevin Thyne;Andres Carbonell;Casey Hall;Sam Ewell;David Michael Stokes;Laura Hoover;Philip Cygan;Stephanie Everhart;Michael Easterbrook	manishkush	Manish Kushwaha	BBa_K1043000	BBa_K1043999

Converting inducer signals into expression of serine recombinases, enzymes capable of specific DNA editing, we are able to create three transcriptional analogues of transistors - transcriptors - and to use them as elemental memory units called SR-latches under control of a fourth, strobe signal, providing a mean to reset the system to its original state. This complex biological memory unit opens the way to cheap, reversible gene induction, useful both to the industry and researchers, not only lowering inducing cost but also being less stressful for the studied organisms, e.g. plants. It is also another step towards Von Neumann-inspired biocomputers.	mradom	Marcin Radom	None	None	przem	Przemyslaw Nuc	None	None	meela;wiera;jakub	Melania Nowicka;Weronika Krzynowek;Jakub Bartoszewicz	None	None	BBa_K1224000	BBa_K1224999

Several challenges have yet to be overcome including design of robust genetic circuits, reliable gene expression, and a standard way to characterize parts. To assess circuit robustness, we utilized the power of the Taguchi Method, a statistical analysis which optimizes a set of parameters to form a robust system against outside noise while minimizing experimental time and cost. Making bicistronic expression operating units, which reduce the variability of gene expression, available in the Registry of Standard Biology Parts will enable efficient engineering of large networks.  Finally, collaboration among teams allowed for a new standardized form of submitting characterization of parts to the Parts Registry. These three approaches to improve part standardization and robustness will help move the field of synthetic biology one step closer to proving that biology can, in fact, be engineered.	jlrickus	Jenna Rickus	None	None	mstine	Janie Brennan	None	None	pmercado;gshowalt;jones274;CThompson;jknolan;yang327;hooc;alecgorge;nmenon;hogan14	Peter Mercado;Gordon Showalter;Amanda Pearl Shanley;Chris Thompson;James Nolan;Xiuyuan Yang;Charlotte Hoo;Alec Gorge;Nidhi Menon;Austin Hogan	jkahn;soojungha	Jen Kahn;Soo Jung Ha	BBa_K1225000	BBa_K1225999

Recent studies have shown that the African mosquito uses human foot odour to locate its host, a trait that is enhanced when the insect is carrying malaria. We plan to combine a carboxylic acid reductase and an acetyl transferase, in order to create E. coli capable of converting a major component of foot odour (isovaleric acid) into banana smell (isoamyl ester). This could have both commercial and humanitarian applications. Our second goal is to deliberately synthesize mosquito attractants inside traps. Recent research has shown that a mixture of CO2 and foot odour volatiles can be more attractive than a human. We have chosen indole as our first attractant, a compound naturally found in human sweat. We hope our project will show that bioremediation and biosynthesis techniques have applications in mosquito control.	chinsang	Ian Chin-Sang	None	None	bendenaw	William Bendena	None	None	chev1n;james.kim;0hb15;MackJamieson;sylvester.chiang;0sec8;spadimaan;Thisiscindyzhu;Colorado_Avs;ttt_zzz;xxmaddy;sunderlandkyl;songwise;emparekh	Kevin Chen;Dongik Kim;Henry Barron;Mackenzie Jamieson;Sylvester Chiang;Stephanie Chan;Sammen Huang;Cindy Ningfu Zhu;Dylan Piette;Tony Zhu;Madeline Tong;Kyle Sunderland;Jin Soo Andy Song;Mitangi Parekh	kok;jallingham	Kenton Ko;John Allingham	BBa_K1121000	BBa_K1121999

CUPID aims for stable obligate symbiosis for the model prokaryote Escherichia coli (bacteria) and the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast). We address this goal by constructing a unique platform for interspecies-dependence based on inducible expression of a required histidine biosynthetic gene (HIS) in each species. Expression of the bacterial HIS gene is induced by lactic acid produced by constitutive expression of a lactate dehydrogenase gene in the eukaryote. Expression of the yeast HIS gene is induced by the binding of its mating factor receptor to mating factor expressed constitutively on the surface of the prokaryote. Histidine deprivation necessitates physical contact and symbiosis for survival. Such pressure may facilitate evolution of a stable exosymbiotic form of the two species. Study of isolates and further manipulation could provide insight into the use of obligate symbiosis in synthetic biology and yield a chassis for the synthesis of novel multicellular machines.

Quorum sensing will be used to detect the presence of high cell densities and to activate pon1 upon detecting high cell density. Pon1, acting as a repressor, will degrade the signal molecules needed for quorum sensing and thus turn off quorum sensing as well as itself. It will reactivate upon the reactivation of quorum sensing and this cycle of self-regulation will persist.

If producing rubber by bacteria succeeds, production of natural rubber will not be limited to the regions where the rubber tree can grow.    Our project aims to make an E. coli strain able to produce natural rubber while grown under controlled conditions. Natural rubber is composed of polymerized IPP (isopentenyl pyrophoshate) units. E. coli already possesses the ability to produce IPP, but it lacks the polymerization enzyme, prenyltransferase, from the rubber tree. In this project we introduce prenyltransferase into E. coli and simultaneously manipulate the bacteria to produce more of the IPP links, consequently leading to the production of natural rubber in the bacterial setting.

We plan to use red, yellow and green fluorescent proteins in a “traffic light” system, whereby the colour of the protein translated corresponds to the concentration of lactose, with red fluorescent protein denoting a high concentration of lactose, yellow fluorescent protein representing a low concentration of lactose and green fluorescent protein showing that there is no lactose present.

Each individual has two kinds of choices--to betray or stay silent, and the choice you make would determine your fate. To betray the other side, you may risk being revenged. While staying silent, companion's betrayal may hurt you deeply. As for our project, we work out a new way to imitate the game theory by constructing a community of two E. Coli bacteria. Here we use the growth rate of each species to represent its fate. The effect of one's silent or betrayal on the other species' fate is acted through intercellular signal molecules of two quorum sensing systems. Each signal molecule regulates the expression of toxic genes in the other species and reduces its growth rate. We characterize the consequence of each strategy by quantitatively measure the growth rates of each species in the community.	linghu_y2k	Wei Huang	None	None	jiankuihe;ZhaoYL	Jiankui He;Yinglan Zhao	None	None	lisa.deep;rossyang;SYZ;HY;Donna;prince;WangJingnong;Yohane;DY	Jingyi Liu;Ningyuan Yang;Yingzhe Shu;Yan He;Dan Chen;zi  wang;Jingnong Wang;Jian Cui;Yan Dai	Lizhong	Liu Lizhong	BBa_K1030000	BBa_K1030999

The picturesque city of Sydney is marred by industrial efflux of chlorinated hydrocarbons into the aquifers around Botany Bay. 1,2-dichloroethane (DCA) is toxic and a suspected carcinogenic agent, and one of the more soluble and mobile contaminants. Conventional DCA treatment is both costly and time-consuming, involving pumping and heat-stripping groundwater. We propose a biological alternative which may be cheaper and more effective. There are strains of bacteria able to degrade low levels of organochlorine compounds in selective conditions.  Polaromonas JS666 and Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10 contain two pathways of particular interest. Our goal is to construct our own versions of two metabolic pathways of DCA biodegradation for comparison in a BioBrick-compatible vector, and characterise their effectiveness in utilising DCA as a sole carbon source for growth. We hope to create friendly strains of bacteria capable of removing DCA at greatly reduced cost and effort, and reduce the environmental impact of industry.

Like embryonic stem cells(ESC), iPS Cells can be differentiated into any tissues. Compared with ESC, iPSC is easier to attain, immune rejection-free, and ethical issue-free. However, Further application of human induced pluripotent stem cells(hiPSCs) in tranlational medicine requires the concerns of two problems: the specificity of directional differentiation and the safety of the transplant. Here we design a new device which can spontaneously select hepatocytes from iPS differentiated cell mass and prevent potential carcinogenesis.To achieve accurate spatiotemporal control,we build a miRNA-122 sensor and make use of the tetracycline induction system.Our work may also be extended to the field of gene therapy, and provide a new direction to our train of thought about how to solve the safety problem in genetic manipulation of human cells.

By harnessing the inherent ability of facultative anaerobic bacteria to colonize and grow in tumoral environments, this project aims to prove the functionality of four different modules that would work together as a bacterial cancer therapy using Escherichia coli as chasis: Toxicity module, Secretion module, Localized induction module, and Internalization module.    The expression of tumor specific therapeutic proteins, Apoptin and TRAIL, conforms the toxicity module. For these proteins to have their effect they need to be located in the extracellular matrix, therefore we are developing a module with a secretion function using hemolysin secretory mechanism. The hypoxic microenvironment present in tumors can be used for the localized induction module of tumor specific proteins, using the promoters HIP and nirB.  Finally, Apoptin needs mechanisms to enter tumor cells’ cytoplasm. Proteins with this requirement could reach the cytoplasm when coupled with the internalization module, resulting in a fusion with the TAT peptide.	GuyCardineau	Guy A.

The LasR system from Pseudomonas Aeruginosa requires the presence of a small molecule, C12-3-oxo-AHL, to induce activation of the Plas promoter. By modifying the -10 and -35 sites of the promoter, as well as shifting the location of the LasR binding sites, the new Plas promoter (Plas*) was changed from an inducible to a repressible promoter. Through adding this second functionality, the Plas* promoter could be used in conjunction with a wildtype Plas promoter to control two separate genes whose expression levels are always out of sync. Furthermore, if the bacteria are transfected with a plasmid encoding LasI, the bacteria will be able to turn off gene expression at a critical population density, instead of only being able to turn on gene expression.	bbelyea	Brinn Belyea	None	None	None	None	None	None	bsmchoi;Mokhshan;cyang1015;Chewbacca;beeread;naimkassira;bethleegy;nickinikkhoy;Tuanminhtran;Biolingual;hopechen;Chene2015	Sun Myung Choi;Mokhshan Ramachandran;Cindy Yang;Tareq Younis;Brandon Read;Naim Kassira;Gha Young Lee;Nicki Nikkhoy;Minh Tran;Michael Margolis;Hope Chen;Eric Chen	sgyounis;spencerrscott	Saed Younis;Spencer Scott	BBa_K980000	BBa_K980999

Within CEST imaging, proteins enclosing hydrogen atoms generate high quality images. We use Escherichia coli to create CEST proteins when the bacteria sense a hypoxic environment due to a promoter designed for this purpose, thus working as a production and delivery system for the CEST MRI contrast agent. Hypoxic regions are related to tumors, therefore our eventual goal is to use this device to target and image tumors in humans by injecting the bacteria into the bloodstream. A second application is tracking bacteria in bacterial infections studies. For the iGEM competition however, the proteins are only expressed ex-vivo: in aerobic and anaerobic conditions. We aim to achieve an efficient testing of the CEST properties of the proteins and confirm the promoter’s ability to express each protein.	mmerkx	Maarten Merkx	None	None	nvriel	Natal van Riel	None	None	ArdjanvanderLinden;pascalaldo;y.chen;NickZon;zc.felix;sanderlr92;JacquesErnes	Ardjan van der Linden;Pascal Pieters;Yicong Chen;Nick van der Zon;Zandra Cecilia Felix Garza;Sander de la Rambelje;Jacques Ernes	None	None	BBa_K1123000	BBa_K1123999

Especially steroid hormones influence the development and generative behavior of fish. The binding of those hormones to progestogen receptors can mistime the reproductive behavior of aquatic organisms and thereby endanger population balance.  Our aim is to construct a yeast-based measurement system for progestin concentration in water samples. Many currently used methods are either very expensive or significantly slower than our method will be. We take advantage of membrane bound receptors in order to achieve high specificity and to speed up measurement.  The binding of the ligand to the receptor stops inhibition of the reporter and thereby initiates its expression through a sensitive signaling-chain. This transcriptional switch allows measurement of very small amounts of substrate. To improve our system we use different interchangeable parts for assembly to get a high variety of possible applications.

Undetected contaminations can render large quantities of food stocks useless – with detrimental effects on the economy and the food supply.    We want to develop a handy device which allows an easy, fast and reliable detection of mycotoxins.     For that our team uses various methods from the fields of synthetic biology, electrical engineering and information processing.    Our system relies on E. coli with modified TAR receptor interacting with specific mycotoxins. If these are present in the sample they induce a conformational change of TAR and thereby generates a measurable FRET-beacon by bringing two fluorophores in close distance to each other.    The modified E. coli will be embedded in exchangeable capsules. Together with a handheld-device and a controlling Smartphone App they will guarantee that measurements can be done quickly, easy to operate and secure.

Here, we intend to build a genetic circuit that results in three discrete states whose transition can be regulated by temperature changes only.

However, current chemical methods for keratin degradation are energetically costly and previous efforts at keratinase production in heterologous hosts have been stymied by poor protease expression. To address both these problems, our team constructed BioBricks based on kerA, a serine keratinase gene native to B. licheniformis active on whole poultry feathers. We designed two biobricks for expression in E. coli and constructed a high copy number BioBrick plasmid with an origin of replication compatible with B. subtilis. By designing a new keratinase expression system in B. subtilis, we hope to provide a faster, cheaper alternative to current methods of industrial keratinase production.	skron	Stephen Kron	None	None	jwchew	Justin Chew	None	None	nvivanco;ielopez;klevinlo;elinak;cweisberg;ndlee;AliceYe;Amisha;dohs;ethanbass;azhangkt;zeruoyang;kengel	Nora Vivanco Gonzalez;Ivan E.

These models have inspired innovations ranging from targeted drug delivery to protein display. Using the major tropism determining (MTD) protein expressed on the Bordatella bacteriophage BPP-1, we aim to develop an in vitro system for generating antibody-like proteins that bind specified targets. The MTD protein expressed at the phage’s tail fiber is naturally modified at its variable region to produce nearly 10e13 possible binding variants while preserving its structure. Mutating the MTD’s variable region by PCR can match the massive diversity of MTD in vitro. A library of MTD protein-DNA fusions generated by mRNA display can then be screened for binding against specified protein targets. This in vitro analog to phage display and immune clonal selection can be a powerful tool for constructing target-binding MTD variants with equally many varied applications.

We are proposing an alternative solution, a home system that converts cellulose into glucose that allows the up-cycling of paper into a commercial product of PHBs.    Consumers who have the home system would be able to rather than put the bio-plastic into a recycling bin to be collected, they can instead exchange their bio-plastic for money. Exchanging recyclable objects for monetary gain, has been used in many European countries where the consumer exchanges plastic and glass bottles.     We decided to construct a two stage apparatus containing two reactors- first reactor contains cellulolytic enzymes that output glucose. A filtered feed from the first enters the second (containing Cupriavidus metallidurans), a PHB producing organism.   Ideally we would like both parts to be contained in one stage reactor where all organisms and enzymes would be placed in one compartment.

There are few ways to target specific strains effectively without disrupting the entire microbiome and local environment. The goal of our project is to take advantage of a natural horizontal gene transfer mechanism in bacteria to precisely affect gene expression in selected strains.  We combine bacterial conjugation with CRISPRi, an RNAi-like repression system developed from bacteria,  to regulate gene expression in targeted strains within a complex microbial community. One possible application is to selectively repress pathogenic genes in a microbiome, leaving the community makeup unaffected. In addition, we use CRISPRi to lay the groundwork for transferring large circuits that enable complex functionality and decision-making in cells.	vzepeda	Veronica Zepeda	None	None	lim;khelmke	Wendell Lim;Kara Helmke Rogers	None	None	kfkearns;vhuang;wyjilily;fjika;pdadlani;dadinh;ebw246;steng1009;Derrlee;ianergui	Kendall Kearns;Verna Huang;JI Weiyue;felicity jika;Priyanka Dadlani;David Dinh;Eric Wong;Sherry Teng;Derrick Lee;Ian Ergui	Graham;susanychen;heineike02;jhaliburton;anshurama	Graham Heimberg;Susan Chen;Benjamin Heineike;John Haliburton;Anusuya Ramasubramanian	BBa_K1062000	BBa_K1062999

Carboxysomes are proteinaceous bacterial microcompartments that evolved to optimize bacterial metabolic reactions. We sought to take advantage of this biological principle to design a platform for in vitro metabolic engineering. Whateversisome it’s based on two hypotheses: the targeting signal to the microcompartment is present in a subunit of RuBisCO and that after isolation Carboxysomes can maintain their metabolic capacity in vitro. To address these hypotheses, we designed a system to target proteins of interest to the Carboxysome using RuBisCO subunits as targeting signals. We showed colocalization of GFP fusion proteins and Carboxysome shell-proteins fused to RFP. Second, we designed a simple system for Carboxysome purification based on biotinylation that should enable easy isolation of recombinant Whateversisomes. Our approach would enable combinatorial in vitro metabolic engineering by producing and combining arbitrary Whateversisomes. This project takes advantage of subcellular organizational principles for metabolic engineering.	gutier24	Rodrigo A.

In order to increase the versatility of expression control systems, we propose a new system coupling transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) with inducible riboswitches. TALEs are proteins secreted by the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas that contain engineerable, sequence-specific DNA binding domains and can act as transcriptional repressors or activators. We plan to manipulate TALE activity by subjecting them to inducible expression through riboswitches and promoters. By pairing TALEs with riboswitches, we can expand the existing library of inducible repression systems.  In addition, we hope to modify the parameters of our system to show the tunability and modularity of our overall construct. Through proper characterization, we believe that iGEM teams may also use these modular repression systems for the development of future devices.	mfacciotti	Marc Facciotti	None	None	iliast;siegeljb	Ilias Tagkopoulos;Justin Siegel	None	None	asoon;lemur3_93;alferreiro;arneckelmann;dHwang	Amy Soon;Lucas Murray;Aura Ferreiro;Alex Neckelmann;David Hwang	NCsicsery;Yaoch;nrai	Nicholas Csicsery;Andrew Yao;Navneet Rai	BBa_K1212000	BBa_K1212999

This includes engineering large synthetic pathways and improving their expression. Overexpression of genes has hitherto mainly been achieved by using high or medium copy plasmids. However, studies have demonstrated that plasmid-bearing cells lose their productivity fairly quickly as a result of genetic instability. Therefore a new method was developed for the overexpression of a gene of interest in the bacterial chromosome: Chemically Inducible Chromosomal evolution (CIChE). In this technique the chromosome is evolved to contain a higher number of gene copies by adding a chemical inducer. The original model for CIChE, however, results in bacterial strains containing a large number of antibiotic resistance genes. To make this valuable technique more widely applicable in the industry, we developed a model for chromosomal evolution based on a toxin-antitoxin system instead of antibiotic resistance.	mademey	Marjan De Mey	None	None	Charlotte_Verniers;fdebruyn;gpeters;picousse	Charlotte Verniers;Frederik De Bruyn;Gert Peters;pieter coussement	None	None	Eline_DS;Tine_Goovaerts;TimH;Marlies_V;Renate_DS;Jules_H;Eva_D	Eline De Schutter;Tine Goovaerts;Tim Hebbrecht;Marlies Verschuuren;Renate De Smedt;Jules Haezebrouck;Eva Dhaene	None	None	BBa_K1105000	BBa_K1105999

Recent studies demonstrate a correlation between CVD and atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaque in the arteries. One associated risk for atherosclerosis is the production of Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) by natural gut flora when metabolizing L-carnitine, a chemical found primarily in red meat and energy drinks.      We created a probiotic to attack the root of this problem by outcompeting the gut bacteria for L-carnitine in order to suppress the production of TMAO. L-carnitine transporters (caiX and cbcWV) and L-carnitine dehydrogenase (CDH) derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa were expressed in a safe strain of E. coli (Nissle 1917). This engineered E. coli can uptake and metabolize L-carnitine along an alternative, safe pathway into 3-dehydrocarnitine. Together, this system offers a novel solution in preventing TMAO-related cardiovascular health conditions.	mmckilli	Melissa McKillip	None	None	SooRin;ysjin;kbhalerao;rao12	Soo Rin Kim;Yong-Su Jin;Kaustubh Bhalerao;Chris Rao	None	None	CathyGXY;rlwalke2;ashleysmoy;msbarbe2;dolatow1;bwilhelmsen;afrana2	Xinyi Guo;Rachel Walker;Ashley S.

The goal of our project is to alleviate this problem by applying synthetic biology to probiotic bacteria.     With our project, we will make the lactobacillus genus the new probiotic platform for metabolic engineering of nutritional compounds. We will engineer probiotics to produce for example beta-carotene, resveratrol, p-coumaric acid, miraculin and saffron. To exemplify what this combination of probiotics and metabolic engineering can accomplish we used our modified bacteria to create nutritionally enriched yoghurt.

Experiments in wet lab could find the effect and choose the best of imported exogenous genes but take a long period of time. gNap utilizes Internet databases to construct a genetic regulatory network (GRN) and analyze the effect of exogenous gene by Michaelis-Menten equation and sequence alignment algorithm. Meanwhile, to guide wet lab experimenters to find the best imported gene in the whole GRN, we use PSO method to figure out the best regulation patterns of new imported genes meeting experimenters’ goal.

S. mutans digests certain sugars, consequently forming lactic acid that can lead to tooth decay. Our system starts with the detection of saccharides essential for S. mutans’ survival. Using dextranase, the E. coli are able to attach onto the dextran layer that S. mutans normally live on. This allows the E. coli to deliver a targeted dose of norspermidine, helping with the breakdown of S. mutans biofilms. We also took another approach that utilizes a natural quorum signaling molecule, competence stimulating peptide (CSP). This peptide is responsible for population control in S. mutans. By using these approaches, we hope to aid in the treatment of cavities in both humans and animals.

Nematodes, such a C. elegans, are fast crawling organisms, but they have limited biotechnological applications. By combining the best from both organisms, we present the first artificial synthetic symbiosis with bacteria engineered to ride on worms, which concentrate in hotspots where bacteria perform a desired biotechnological process, such as bioplastic (PHA) production. We have engineered Pseudomas putida with a whole operon that allows the formation of a biofilm on the worm. Biofilm formation is swhitched on and off depending on the media, and thus bacteria get on and off the worm like travellers on a bus. We have also engineered a third partner, E. coli, to express an interference RNA that promotes clumping. Taken together, our artificial symbiosis allows biotechnologically interesting bacteria to travel on nematodes, reach nutrient-rich biomass spots and maximize the efficiency of biotechnological fermentations in heterogenous substrates.	manelwatanabe	Manuel Porcar	None	None	rogilgar;jpico;moya;julipereto;Matallana;daravi;martorse	Rosario Gil;Jesus Pico;Andrés Moya;Juli Pereto;Emilia Matalllana;Daniel Ramón Vidal;Marta Tortajada	None	None	Alba;guizare;PedroLDM;aluzcor;samiver;jesdelo;Nightm4re;tonnyESP;beta3designs;marinamch92	Alba Iglesias Vilches;Guillermo Zafrilla Requena;Pedro Luis Dorado Morales;Alba Luz Corman Ruiz;Samuel Miravet Verde;Jessica de Loma Olson;Alejandro Torres Solano;Antonio Ruiz Gijón;Alejandro Valero-Andreu;Marina Mañas-Cháfer	lujemomo;Cristina_VS;alejovigno;serloma;gabbosch	Lucas Jesús Morales Moya;Cristina Vilanova;Alejandro Vignoni;Sergio López-Madrigal;Gabriel Bosque Chacón	BBa_K1112000	BBa_K1112999

The lack of a chromosome renders minicells unable to replicate and cause infection, yet they still retain and express plasmid genes.  Furthermore, minicells inherit the stable, non-leaky membranes and cytosolic composition from their parent cell. Our project design is centered on the creation of an IPTG-inducible FtsZ Biobrick that permits tunable overexpression for optimal minicell production. With the development of a multi-purpose, innocuous bacterial chassis as our ultimate goal, we incorporated three additional safety elements: the Ail protein, a polysialic acid capsule and de-acylated lipopolysaccharide. Both Ail and the PSA capsule serve to prevent complement deposition on the surface of the minicells, with PSA also protecting against antibody opsonization.

Green Light!	Refinement of functional systems is a key aspect of engineering. Biological systems are not immune to this fact and must be continuously improved to function consistently, and reliably.  Creating easy methods for tuning biological systems using light was the goal of this year's effort.  Our team sought to improve on a previous light-regulated gene expression method, integrate the use of tablet device for testing, and create multiple functional biobrick constructs. In 2012, we developed an app that affords any researcher with access to an android device with a LED screen the ability to illuminate cells in a controlled manner for synthetic biology applications. We improved the functionality of the app by adding a mini petri dish setting and demonstrated the advantages of paralization by performing experiments in a 96 well plate format. This tablet application represents the first real life example of using a mobile device as synthetic biology instrument.

This year, our iGEM team worked on harnessing the power of nif to produce ammonia in Escherichia coli. After synthesizing a nif-containing plasmid (28 kbp) using the DNA assembler method (Shao et al 2009) and transforming that plasmid into E. coli, our team tested for nitrogenase activity using the acetylene reduction assay. The transformed E. coli were then compared to wild-type under limited nitrogen conditions to check for a competitive advantage. Tests were used to evaluate the expression of various nitrogenase subunits. Our team also aimed to further characterize the promoter sequences of the Cyanothece 51142 nif cluster. Between the cysE and nifB genes, there is a 958bp uncharacterized, bidirectional promoter region of particular interest. We used fluorescent reporters to identify key regions within this promoter sequence under various environmental conditions.	jjez	Joseph Jez	None	None	None	None	None	None	psoss;Jkottapalli;rebeccashih;jluskin;btodd2	Philip Sossenheimer;Jagdeesh Kottapalli;Rebecca Shih;Jonathan Luskin;Benjamin Todd	cimmethun;andrew.ng;yenamelia;bertramberla	Cheryl Immethun;Andrew Ng;Amelia Nguyen;Bertram Berla	BBa_K1169000	BBa_K1169999

Engineers seeking complex programmed population-level behavior     require tools enabling controlled, information-rich intercellular messaging. Given     its versatility and universality as an information-encoding molecule, DNA suggests     itself as a message-carrying molecule to enable information-rich messaging. The     Endy group at Stanford recently published a proof-of-principle demonstration of     such DNA messaging wherein a DNA message was transmitted from one bacterial     population to another carried by M13 bacteriophage particles. Here we propose an     intercellular communication program that extends DNA messaging by controlling     modification and transmission of a DNA message. Modification is controlled     through flipping a DNA switch on the message DNA – a promoter sequence that is     invertible using serine integrases and recombination directionality factors (RDFs).     Transmission is controlled by placing expression of the M13 major coat protein,     which is required for viral packaging of message DNA, under control of such a     switch.	ingalls	Brian Ingalls	None	None	None	None	None	None	lyianndga;AnnasKhan;honpeter;nphidd;AnjaliA.;paulreginato;aaronb;Lilycloud;hbandukw;ukishor;nelk;Q24hu;mkalia05;daniel.zl.zhang;suzie_alex;jahagiyu;j2manali;peivandsm;samadani;vpvyas;Brunix;sdhirnia;mattsmart;jpdrake;jrhawley;moses;DrewN;eileenp;chrism91;harry.m.gandhi;dejan56	Linda Yang;Annas Khan;Joon Hyuk Hong;Natasha Phidd;Kusumanjali (Anjali) Arya;Paul Reginato;Aaron Bender;JunWen Li;Hina Bandukwala;Urooj Kishor;Alex Klen;Lucy Hu;Mudit Kalia;Daniel Zhang;Suzie Alexander;Jama Hagi-Yusuf;Julia Manalil;Peivand Sadat Mousavi;Seyed Ali;Vedang Vyas;Brandon Fung;Samantha Hirniak;Matt Smart;John Drake;James Hawley;Moses Wanyonyi;Drew Neish;Eileen Peng;Chris Morcos;Harry Gandhi;Dejan Cvijanovic	None	None	BBa_K1039000	BBa_K1039999

The current chemical method of synthesizing PLA is expensive, and the required processing and purifying steps use many environmentally unfriendly chemicals. Recently, E. coli has been engineered to produce PLA, but low yields and short chain lengths prevent the approach’s commercial use. Here, we evaluate the potential of using multiplex automated genome engineering to raise both yields and chain lengths of biosynthesized PLA by directing the E. coli metabolism to funnel resources toward PLA production without sacrificing the organism’s viability. Efficient biosynthesis of PLA, which may be thus achieved, would be a significant step in reducing the impact of plastic waste, and would benefit those receiving bone implants. It would also open up a new possibility in rapid manufacturing of personalized bone implants using three-dimensional printers.

Acetaldehyde is a toxic and carcinogenic component of cigarette smoke. It has a boiling point of 20.2C and is very volatile, thus can be used as an information carrier through air. The SmoColi cells are immobilized in an agarose-filled microfluidic device. The test solution is fed on one end of a microfluidic channel, in which an acetaldehyde gradient is established by synthetic cellular degradation. The cells are engineered to sense acetaldehyde by a synthetically re-designed fungal acetaldehyde-responsive transactivator. The sensor is linked to a band-pass filter that drives GFP expression. This allows establishment of an input-concentration-dependent, spatially located fluorescent band displaying quantitative information about acetaldehyde. Finally, if the acetaldehyde concentration exceeds the threshold of malignance, a quorum-sensing-based mCherry alarm system springs into action, turning the whole device red.	sven	Sven Panke	None	None	joergs	Joerg Stelling	None	None	luwidmer;sabineoesterle;irenak;laurabu;smurmann;emichael	Lukas Widmer;Sabine Österle;Irena Kuzmanovska;Laura Buzdugan;Sebastian Murmann;Michael Eichenberger	langmo	Moritz Lang	BBa_K625000	BBa_K625999

Our system is based on a comparison between an unknown mercury concentration and a known IPTG concentration. A linear IPTG gradient is present on a test-strip containing the engineered bacteria. When the mercury solution is added, the regulatory network will switch to one of two states depending on the IPTG/mercury ratio. Bacteria become either 'sender' or 'receiver'. The bacteria sensing a predominance of mercury over IPTG, the 'senders', will release a quorum sensing molecule which is detected by the nearby 'receivers'. The reception of quorum sensing molecules will induce the expression of a red dye in the 'receivers'. In this way, a red line emerges at a position in the IPTG gradient from which the unknown mercury concentration can be deduced.	hans_geiselmann	Johannes Geiselmann	None	None	weidenhm;yves_markowicz;Bruckert;dejong;ropers	marianne weidenhaupt;Yves Markowicz;Franz Bruckert;hidde de jong;Delphine Ropers	None	None	MorganeDG;maxime.huet;cerevisiea;Navrique;Sammy;Feriel;Pinillarobin;BouGeo7314;Marion;Tiflonx;JeanBaptiste	Morgane DE GASPERI;Maxime HUET;MASSON Clément;Éric DURANDAU;MENAD Samia;MELAÏNE Feriel;Pinilla robin;BOUCHAGE Geoffrey;Marion CRISTEA;Felix Ciceron;Jean-Baptiste Lugagne	StephP	Stéphane PINHAL	BBa_K545000	BBa_K545999

To ameliorate worldwide malnutrition, we engineered baker's yeast to produce vitamins A and C. 'VitaYeast' can be used to bake bread without special equipment, training, orreagents. We designed our genetic constructs using state-of-the-art optimization techniques, simulations, and data from our parts characterization experiments. In order to realize this design, we developed an extensive yeast toolkit including promoters, UTRs, and vectors. We synthesized the violacein pathway, which, combined with our vitamins and intermediate metabolites, represent a new set of yeast reporters. Finally, to assess the potential of VitaYeast to combat hunger in the real world, we have sought IRB approval to distribute an extensive survey on attitudes toward genetic engineering of food world-wide.	caiyizhi	Yizhi Cai	None	None	doctorbee54;oster@jhu.edu;Takanari	Jef Boeke;Marc Ostermeier;Takanari Inoue	None	None	nyoung;rpassar3;arjunkhakhar;henrym7;danielw9;aveerak1;mkhalil4;ohadzip1;jyu43;sliu55;jchuang;SunPenguin;putarut;brookjeang;Daphne;dbibl1	Noah Young;Roberto Passaro;Arjun Khakhar;Henry Ma;Daniel Wolozny;Ashan Veerakumar;Maher Khalil;Omar Hadzipasic;Justine Yu;Steffi Liu;James Chuang;Ang Andy Tu;Putarut Suntharanund;Brook Jeang;Wui Yarn Chan;Daniel Bibl	stracquadanio;lmitch24	Giovanni Stracquadanio;Leslie Mitchell	BBa_K530000	BBa_K530999

Casso: Artistic E. Coli inspired by random color generation	E. Casso is an E. coli system engineered to perform art. The system consists of two types of genetically modified E. coli: the random signal generating E. coli ('Brush E. coli') and the color generating E. coli ('Paint E. coli'). Brush E. coli possesses genes (lasI, luxI, rhlI, and cinI) in its gDNA that produce quorum molecules. On the other hand, by modified Cre-loxP mechanism, gDNA is randomly set to secrete only one of the four types of quorum molecules. Paint E.coli possesses plasmids that express one of four colors (red, cyan, yellow, and green) by producing fluorescent proteins in response to the type of quorum it receives from Brush E.coli. As Paint E.coli expresses corresponding fluorescence in response, it also produces quorum molecule that is identical to the inducer to start propagation. Ultimately, using this system, the 'random' contribution of cells will create art on an LB plate.	sunkim	Sun Chang Kim	None	None	wandra;star_cho	Wan-Taek Im;Byung-Kwan Cho	None	None	KwangR;joomyjoo;imb10;janihyo;John0501;Jijung;zoshsxla;sso;ksekse;qhwa1005	Kwang Ryeol Lee;Jooyoung Chang;NAMBIN YIM;Ji Han Hyo;Young Jun Jo;Ji Jung Jung;Woo Gwang Sim;Sohyun Yoon;Suneung KIM;Jeong Hyun Lee	None	None	BBa_K623000	BBa_K623999

In poor availability of combined nitrogen, carnivorous E.coli emit light and attract bugs by using bioluciferase,  then catch and digest them by mucilage and catabolic enzymes. To create carnivorous E.coli, we set up four sub-goals: hunger, luminescence, predation and digestion. In 'hunger', We measure activity of Ïƒ54 promoter with nitrogen regulatory protein, the activator.   These promoter and protein enable E.coli to responce concentration of amino acids.

The first component uses the xylene degradation pathway of Pseudomonas putida optimized by the use of a protein microcompartment produced from the engineered Aquifex aeolicus protein lumazine synthase.  The second component  removes heavy metals by producing nanoparticles with the Magnetospirillum magneticum protein Mms6.

The problems are reduction in land available for food production, relatively low levels of CO2 biofixation, and large biomass requirements. Our project aims to overcome these problems by utilizing E. coli for the production of biodiesel (C-12 fatty acids) and bioethanol. There have been a number of examples of biofuel production in E. coli; however 30-40% of production cost is based on media costs. Our project will surmount these high production costs by engineering the cyanobacteria, Synechocystis PCC6803, to secrete large quantities of glucose that will feed our biofuel-producing E .coli. Cyanobacteria and E.coli will be co-cultivated to allow the mutual transfer of carbon to produce biofuels.  This project provides an efficient means for producing biofuels without a carbon source.

One is to use any codon but initial codons to initiate translation, the other is to use stop codon as the controlling element. Moreover, our design would be a brand-new way to selectively express part of a gene or introduce point mutations into target residues in proteins, thus favoring the study of the important domains or residues of a target protein.

K. Rowling's popular novels, we recreate a fantastic world where patronus are produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae to fight against dementors inside the cell. Ethanol fermented by yeast from lignocellulosic materials can be an environmentally friendly fuel. However, rapid and efficient fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates is limited because of inhibitors generated during pretreatment in addition to monomeric sugars. Inhibitors strongly affect the normal physiology of yeast as well as its ethanol productivity, just like the dementors taking away people's hope and happiness. Nevertheless, we reconstruct TOR protein, a central component of major signaling transduction network controlling cell growth, to increase the tolerance of yeast. A new TOR after directional mutation will play the role of patronus to defend the influence of inhibitors, keep the overall signaling networks in good order, and finally provide a prosperous world for ethanol production.	yingjinyuan	Yingjin Yuan	None	None	WenyuLu	Wenyu Lu	None	None	zengbouxan;Moocici;Jiabin;ryf0100;thlff;gj050680xy;amanilaimeng;island139;toushirou_1220;RenHengqian;austinamens;Cyantju;Debelle	Boxuan Zeng;Saisi Xue;Bin Jia;Yunfei Ran;Enxu Wang;Guo Jing;Mingrui Zhao;Wenbin Kuang;Andi Wangzhou;Hengqian Ren;Qinfeng Wu;Yan Chen;Dai Tang	None	None	BBa_K563000	BBa_K563999

To overcome this, we devise an inducible self- assembling system in Escherichia coli utilizing L-aspartate (L-Asp) chemotaxis. Our system consists of two cell types: 'guiders' and 'workers'. When exposed to a signal, the former discharge and generate a signal-centered spatial L-Asp gradient, and the latter lose motility by repression of a flagellum-regulating gene (cheZ). These cells remain at the source of the signal and cannot escape.

Moreover we have measured the RBS parts with various fluorescent proteins and they are not as standard as we would like them to be. The strength of a RBS part depends on the protein used. Why? Because the beginning of the protein influences the mRNA fold. We came up with the idea of RBS parts fused with short 'protein beginnings' -  expression adapters. Using genetic algorithm we designed expression adapters that would provide standardized protein expression or increase expression of your favorite protein.

The WashU iGEM team hopes to address this issue by creating a transgenic strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) that produces beta-carotene, the precursor to vitamin A. The WashU team created four DNA constructs for homologous recombination into the S. cerevisiae genome that will catalyze the production of beta-carotene. Each construct consisted of a gene encoding an enzyme from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous, a bacterium that produces beta-carotene. Three of the constructs encode for enzymes in the metabolic pathway required for beta-carotene production, while a fourth enzyme cleaves beta-carotene to form beta-ionone, a rose-scented compound used in the fragrance industry. Additionally, the WashU team has established spectraphotometric assays to detect beta-carotene and beta-ionone in yeast extract. Although we have yet to successfully incorporate these four genes into S. cerevisiae, we have prepared all four constructs and biobricked these genes for future use.	jjez	Joseph Jez	None	None	None	None	None	None	jonathanlin;j.herrmann;zhangcong;Maymeifu;rdpruden;mikekim9293;vbostrom;bdonaldson;crhoades	"Jonathan Lin;Jonathan Herrmann;Cong Zhang;May Fu;Roy Pruden;Seong Hwan ""Mike"" Kim;Valerie Bostrom;Brad Donaldson;Colleen Rhoades"	BrianLandry;cohen	Brian Landry;Barak Cohen	BBa_K552000	BBa_K552999
